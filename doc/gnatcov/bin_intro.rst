Definition and main characteristics
-----------------------------------

Unlike *source traces* produced by the execution of instrumented
programs in their regular environment, :dfn:`binary traces` are
coverage trace files produced by the execution of uninstrumented
programs under the control of an instrumented execution environment.
*"Binary"* in this designation refers to the nature of the collected
data, which consists in low level information about executed blocks of
machine instructions.

From binary traces, |gcp| is able to compute both *source coverage*
metrics as with source traces, and :dfn:`object coverage` metrics
assessing the coverage of machine level instructions.  |gcp| supports
two criteria of the latter kind:

- :dfn:`Instruction Coverage`, where we evaluate for each machine instruction
  whether it has been executed at least once or not; and

- :dfn:`Branch Coverage`, where we also evaluate for each conditional
  branch instruction whether it was only taken, or went fallthrough or both.

Source coverage metrics are only available for a subset of the target
configurations supported with source traces, though, and new tool
functionalities are most often implemented for source traces only.

The matrix below summarizes the main characteristics of the two
trace production modes:

Workflow overview
-----------------

A high level view comparing the processes involved in the use of
binary or source traces is provided on :numref:`fig-flow_compare`. The
use of coverage *traces* in both modes allows lots of similarities
between workflows, in particular in the steps processing traces after
they have been produced.

We don't support mixing the two kinds of traces together, though, and have
depicted a separate analysis/consolidation step to emphasize this:

  Workflows using source or binary coverage traces

For binary traces, |gcv| relies on an instrumented execution
environment to produce the traces instead of having to instrument the
program itself with extra code and data structures. |gem| provides
such an environment for bareboard configurations, as well as hardware
probes assisted with means to convert their output to the format |gcv|
expects.

Programs are built from their original sources, only requiring the use of
:cmd-option:`-g -fpreserve-control-flow -fdump-scos` compilation options to
generate coverage obligation lists and let us associate execution traces to
these obligations afterwards.



A simple example
----------------

For the original "Getting Started" use case, we first use the GNAT Pro
toolset for ``powerpc-elf`` to build, using :command:`gprbuild` as
follows::

   gprbuild --target=powerpc-elf --RTS=light-mpc8641 -Ptests.gpr \
     -cargs -g -fpreserve-control-flow -fdump-scos

We pass the project file with ``-P``, the required compilation flags
with ``-cargs`` and request the use of a ``light`` runtime library tailored
for the ``mpc8641`` board.

The build command produces a ``test_inc`` executable in the object
subdirectory. To automate the execution of this program within |gem|
to produce a trace, we provide the |gcvrun| command. For the use case
at hand, we would simply do::

  gnatcov run --target=powerpc-elf obj-tests/test_inc


This produces a ``test_inc.trace`` binary trace file in the current
directory.  By default, such a trace is amenable to statement and decision
coverage at most. If MCDC analysis is needed, ``--level=stmt+mcdc`` must be
passed to |gcvrun| as well and we recommend also providing source coverage
obligations in this case.

Producing report is then achieved as for sources traces, using the
binary trace files as inputs to the |gcvcov| commands.

Units of interest can be conveyed with either the GPR oriented
facilities as with source traces, or with :cmd-option:`--scos`
switches to provide lists of files holding coverage obligations in a
similar fashion as :cmd-option:`--sid` switches for ``.sid`` files out
of source instrumentation.

The files to list with :cmd-option:`--scos` are the *Library
Information* files produced by the compiler along with object files,
which are ``.ali`` files for Ada and ``.gli`` files for C.

The GNAT toolchain provides a helpful device in this process for Ada
units: the :cmd-option:`-A` command line argument to
:command:`gnatbind` which produces a list of all the ``.ali`` files
involved in an executable construction.  By default, the list goes to
standard output. It may be directed to a file on request with
:cmd-option:`-A=<list-filename>`, and users may of course filter this
list as they see fit depending on their analysis purposes.

Below is a complete example sequence of commands to illustrate, using
the standard Unix ``grep`` tool to filter out test harness units::

    # Build executable and produce the corresponding list of ALI files. Pass
    # -A to gnatbind through gprbuild -bargs then filter out the test units:
    gprbuild -p --target=powerpc-elf --RTS=light-mpc8641 -Ptests.gpr
      -cargs -fdump-scos -g -fpreserve-control-flow -bargs -A=all.alis

    # Run and analyse all units except the test harness, filtering out
    # the correspond ALI files from the list:
    grep -v 'test_[^/]*.ali' all.alis > nontest.alis
    gnatcov run --level=stmt+mcdc --scos=@nontest.alis
    gnatcov coverage --level=stmt+mcdc --annotate=xcov --scos=@nontest.alis

Going Further
-------------

As the source and binary trace based workflows share commonalities,
a lot of information from the main documentation also applies to the
use binary traces, such as

- The use of project files to specify command switches or designate
  units of interest at analysis time,

- Using coverage checkpoints or traces for consolidation,

- Defining exemptions regions with pragmas for Ada. The support
  for other languages is not available for binary traces.

Then this appendix holds separate chapters dedicated to binary trace
specific considerations:

- :ref:`bin_traces`

- :ref:`ocov`

- :ref:`osmetrics`

- :ref:`bin_convert`
