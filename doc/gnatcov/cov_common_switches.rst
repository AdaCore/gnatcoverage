:cmd-option:`--timezone` :
   Select the timezone to use when displaying trace creation dates in
   reports, which could be either ``local`` or ``utc``. The local timezone
   is used by default.

:cmd-option:`--output-dir` :
   Request that the report files (index and annotated sources for the
   ``xcov``, ``html`` and ``dhtml`` output formats) be output in the provided
   directory. If not specified, the default is the root project's object
   directory if using projects, and the current directory if not.
   If more than one of the above annotation formats is requested, then each
   report will be placed in a subdirectory named accordingly.

:cmd-option:`--report-title` :
   Request that generated HTML documents (index and annotated sources for the
   ``html`` and ``dhtml`` output formats) are assigned a customized title. For
   instance, passing ``--report-title="Project ABC"`` will yield titles such
   as: ``Project ABC - GNATcoverage Report``. If passed multiple times, passing
   an empty string last will restore the default behavior. This option is
   ignored is the selected output format does not support titles.

:cmd-option:`-T`, :cmd-option:`--trace` |marg|, |rarg| :
   Provide the set of execution traces for which a report is to be
   produced. When multiple traces are provided, |gcv| produces a consolidated
   result, as described in detail in the :ref:`consolidation` chapter of this
   manual.

:cmd-option:`--exec`:
   Override executable from traces. Trace files contain an indication of the
   executable used to generate them. This option causes the named executable to
   be loaded for coverage analysis, and to override the indication contained in
   any trace specified after it on the command line. An empty executable name
   may be specified to restore the default behaviour of using the indication
   contained in each trace file. Note that :cmd-option:`--exec` may appear last
   on the command line, in which case it applies to no trace file, but still
   causes the indicated executable to be included in the coverage analysis.
   This ensures that any code in that executable that is not exercised by some
   trace file will be reported as not covered.
