Using GNATtest with |gcp|
#########################

Using |gcp| to obtain coverage information on the project being tested is the
next logical step in the GNATtest workflow. There are two main ways to
accomplish this:
:ref:`using the facilities generated by GNATtest <Gnattest_Makefile>` (namely
a Makefile) during the harness generation, or
:ref:`deriving a custom solution <CUstom_Integration>`,
while keeping a few important concepts in mind.

.. _Gnattest_Makefile:

****************************************
Using the Makefile generated by GNATtest
****************************************

GNATtest will always generate a Makefile to automate as much as possible the
production of a coverage report on the project being tested.

This Makefile is generated in the same directory as the harness project, and
consists of two files:

* The main ``Makefile`` which is regenerated for each invocation of ``gnattest``
* The ``coverage_settings.mk`` secondary makefile, which holds most of the
  options that will be passed to gnatcoverage. The values present when the
  file is generated are extracted from the root project file that was passed
  to GNATtest. This file will not be re-generated by subsequent invocation of
  ``gnattest``, so it is a suitable place to store settings for |gcp| if they
  are not all defined in the project file.

The makefile also assumes that the |gcp| runtime is already built and installed,
and that the path to its project file is in the environment variable
``GPR_PROJECT_PATH`` so it can be automatically located by GPRbuild.
It is also possible to specify the path to the project file in the
``GNATCOV_RTS`` variable in the ``coverage_settings.mk`` file. See
:ref:`instr-rts` for instructions on building and installing the runtime.

If all the switches that need to be passed to |gcp| are correctly defined in
``coverage_Settings.mk``, then running:

  ::

    make coverage

will build and run all the harness projects and then generate a coverage report
for all the units under test.

By default, coverage data for a native project is obtained using
:ref:`source traces <src_traces>` and coverage for projects targeting
a cross environment is assessed using :ref:`binary traces
<bin_traces>`.

For cases where the default behavior isn't appropriate for the project under
test, the rules for producing a coverage report from both kind of traces are
always generated.

Special considerations for cross environment targets
====================================================

Using |gcp| to assess coverage for a project with a cross-environment target
may require some special adaptation to be able to run the program and collect
execution traces. The generated makefile tries to implement an execution and
trace collection strategy that is the most likely to work for most projects,
based on GNATemulator for execution.

For binary traces, this is done through the ``gnatcov run`` command (see
:ref:`gnatcov_run-commandline`), which takes care of setting up the trace
collection mechanism in GNATemulator. For this configuration to work properly,
the ``Board`` attribute in the package ``Emulator`` needs to be specified in
the root project file, or alternatively the ``GNATEMU_BOARD`` variable must be
set in the ``coverage_settings.mk`` secondary makefile.

For source traces, the instrumented program will be run using GNATemulator
directly, and assumes that the standard package Ada.GNAT_IO allows data to be
output on a serial port. The instrumentation process overrides the two switches
:cmd-option:`--dump-trigger` and :cmd-option:`--dump-channel` to the values
``main-end`` and ``base64-stdout`` respectively as they are the most adapted to
the GNATtest harness project and to the GNATemulator execution environment.
The program is run under GNATemulator, and the output of the first serial port
is captured as it contains the trace in a base-64 encoding. This text trace is
then decoded and converted into a regular source trace.

There is currently no out-of-the-box support for running the GNATtest harness
projects on target and collect execution traces from a hardware probe; the
current makefile can still be used to compile the executables and process the
traces once they are available, but the execution rules will need rewriting.

Usage example
=============

In this example the project has two units, ``Pkg1`` and ``Pkg2``. The code in
``Pkg2`` calls all the subprograms in ``Pkg1``, and we wish to unit test each
unit in isolation. To do so, we will use the :ref:`Individual_Test_Drivers`
feature of GNATtest so each unit under test gets its own test executable, and
we'll be able to create each time a checkpoint containing coverage for the
unit being tested. See :ref:`incidental_coverage` on how checkpoints help
avoid incidental coverage.

The project is structured as follows::

  <project root directory/>
    |prj.gpr
    |src/
      |pkg1.ads
      |pkg2.ads
      ...
    |tests/
      |<gnattest generated test skeletons>
    |harness/
      |Makefile
      |coverage_settings.mk
      |<GNATtest generated harness files>

and is defined with the following project file:

.. code-block:: ada

  --  prj.gpr
  project Prj is
     for Source_Dirs use ("src");
     for Object_Dir use "obj";

     package Coverage is
        Cov_Level := ("--level=stmt");
        for Switches ("instrument") use ("--dump-trigger=atexit") & Cov_Level;
        for Switches ("run") use Cov_Level;
        for Switches ("coverage") use ("--annotate=report") & Cov_Level;
     end Coverage;

     package Gnattest is
        for Tests_Dir use "../tests";
        for Harness_Dir use "../harness";
     end Gnattest;

  end Prj;

Specifying the coverage preferences in the project file spares us modifying the
``coverage_settings.mk`` after generation.

The tests will be stored in the ``tests`` directory, as specified by the project
attribute ``Tests_Dir``, and the GNATtest generated harness in the ``harness``
directory.

After invoking GNATtest as follows:

  ::

    gnattest -P prj.gpr --separate-drivers=unit

The following two files can be found in the harness directory:

* The ``Makefile`` with (amongst other things) three rules that execute the
  full coverage workflow for each test driver project, and then generates a
  coverage report combining the results:

  .. code-block:: Makefile

    bin-coverage: ...

    inst-coverage: ...

    coverage: inst-coverage

  The first rule (``bin-coverage``) runs the binary traces workflow for |gcp|,
  whereas the second rule (``inst-coverage``) runs the source-trace (or
  instrumentation based) workflow. The last rule (``coverage``) is defined to
  use the workflow the most likely to work given the current target.

* The ``coverage_settings.mk`` file, which, when generated, copied all the
  values of the relevant root project attributes into corresponding variables:

  .. code-block:: Makefile

    # Settings in this file were extracted from the source project
    # or are gnattest default values if they weren't specified in the source
    # project. They may need adjustments to fit your particular coverage needs.
    # This file won't be overwritten when regenerating the harness.

    # Switches for the various gnatcov commands
    SWITCHES_INSTRUMENT=--dump-trigger=main-end --level=stmt

    SWITCHES_RUN=--level=stmt

    SWITCHES_COVERAGE=--annotate=report --level=stmt

    # Path to the installed gnatcov rts project file.
    # No need to specify it if the project file path was added to the
    # GPR_PROJECT_PATH environment variable.
    GNATCOV_RTS=

  There is an empty ``GNATCOV_RTS`` variable defined, which we can set to the
  path to the installed gnatcov runtime project file.

Once the tests are all written, generating the coverage report (on the
standard output in this example) can be done by simply invoking::

  make -C harness/ coverage

This outputs the sequence of commands issued to perform the coverage
computation, then the results if the "report" format is selected. On our
example, this would be like:

.. code-block:: none

  ** END OF REPORT **

The log shows all the steps necessary to obtain coverage results from the
multiple test drivers, and end with the report.

From the coverage report, we see that the only lines not covered are in
``pkg1.adb``, which is expected as the tests corresponding to that unit are
not implemented. By using separate drivers, although the code in ``Pkg2`` uses
the subprograms defined in ``Pkg1``, we were able to not have the coverage
results from the unit tests on ``Pkg1`` be polluted by the tests on ``Pkg2``.

Regenerating the harness to use a single monolithic driver, and re-generating a
coverage report shows that without the separate drivers, ``Pkg1`` is marked as
covered despite not having any test implemented::

  gnattest -P prj.gpr && make -C harness/ coverage

.. _gnattest_spark_instrument:

Instrumenting test harnesses for a SPARK project
================================================

General information about SPARK code instrumentation can be found in section
:ref:`spark_instr`.
The compilation of instrumented user code needs to be controlled by a
configuration pragma file. When using GNATtest, the main project is the
generated test driver project, not the original user code project. As such,
the configuration pragma files that need to be passed during compilation
cannot be specified in the project under test.

There are two possibilities to specify the configuration pragma file to be
used when building the instrumented harness projects. The first one is to
modify the ``gnattest_common.gpr`` project file (which is not overwritten when
the harness is regenerated), as in:

.. code-block:: diff

  --- harness/gnattest_common.gpr
  +++ harness/gnattest_common.gpr
    type TD_Compilation_Type is ("contract-checks","no-contract-checks", "no-config-file");
    TD_Compilation : TD_Compilation_Type := external ("TEST_DRIVER_BUILD_MODE", "no-config-file");

    package Builder is
       case TD_Compilation is
          when "contract-checks" =>
             for Global_Configuration_Pragmas use "suppress.adc";
          when "no-contract-checks" =>
             for Global_Configuration_Pragmas use "suppress_no_ghost.adc";
          when "no-config-file" =>
  -          null;
  +          for Global_Configuration_Pragmas use "<path to file>/instrument-spark.adc";;
       end case;
    end Builder;

An alternative solution is to specify the configuration pragma file on the
command line when invoking the Makefile::

  make BUILDERFLAGS='-cargs:Ada -gnatec=instrument-spark.adc' coverage

.. _Custom_Integration :

****************************
Developing a custom solution
****************************

If the generated makefile is not suitable to use with the execution environment,
there are a few things to keep in mind in order not to have unexpected coverage
results.

Single test driver
==================

In the case where a monolithic test driver is generated by GNATtest, obtaining
coverage results for your project is relatively simple, and the only aspect
which needs attention is the specification of units of interest, particularly
in the case of using source traces.

When using source traces, |gcp| needs to instrument the main so that execution
traces are dumped at the end of the test run. So despite none of the units in
the harness project being of interest, is is important that the root project
passed to all |gcv| commands is ``test_driver.gpr``.

The projects generated by GNATtest all specify that none of the units are of
interest, so none of the units generated by GNATtest should appear in the
reports.

Separate test drivers
=====================

Using separate test drivers is advisable to avoid incidental coverage of one
unit from the testing of other units (see :ref:`incidental_coverage`).  Note
that since the smallest division of a project supported by |gcp| is the unit,
there is no benefit in specifying :cmd-option:`--separate-drivers=test` instead
of :cmd-option:`--separate-drivers=unit` to GNATtest, as far as incidental
coverage is concerned.

When using mutliple drivers, there will be a ``test_driver.gpr`` generated for
each unit. For each generated driver, the project needs to be instrumented
(if source traces are used), built, run and a :ref:`checkpoint <checkpoints>`
must be created from the execution trace. Then a call to |gcvcov| merges the
coverage data from all the checkpoints and generates the desired report.

The key point in the process is to specify, when creating all the individual
checkpoints, which unit is being tested, so that the checkpoint only records
the coverage information about that unit, and discard any incidental coverage
on other units. During harness generation, a file named ``units.list`` will be
created in the same directory as each ``test_driver.gpr`` file. This file
contains the name of the unit tested by the driver, and can be used to specify
to |gcv| to only process the unit under test, by adding the switch
:cmd-option:`--units=@units.list`.

.. _Gnattest_Gnatfuzz:

###########################################
Using GNATtest with GNATfuzz (experimental)
###########################################

This section presents how a pre-existing GNATtest test harness can be used as
a starting corpus for a GNATfuzz fuzzing campaign, and how inputs of interest
found by GNATfuzz can be imported back into a GNATtest harness. These features
are still experimental; the workflow and command line interface may change in
the future.

**************************
Setting up the environment
**************************

To ensure the entire workflow functions properly, it's crucial to configure
the various tools by setting specific environment variables.

The first step is to setup the value generation runtime library. For detailed
instructions on how to do so, see :ref:`Tgen_Env`.

*******************************************
Using GNATStudio to perform the integration
*******************************************

The simplest way to sequence the invocations of the two tools is to use the
GNATstudio integration plugin.

First, create a GNATtest harness project if it doesn't already exist, using the
``Analyze -> GNATtest -> Generate harness project`` entries in the menu bar.
Note that in the dialog box opening there is an option to generate tests inputs
if needed.

Then, exporting tests inputs from GNATtest to GNATfuzz and running a fuzzing
campaign on a specific subprogram can be done by right-clicking on the
declaration of the target subprogram, then selecting
``GNATtest -> Start/Stop fuzzing subprogram``, as illustrated bellow.

.. Image:: gs_menu.png

This will first instrument sources and re-generate the GNATtest harness in order
to be able to intercept the inputs passed to the subprogram, then run the test
harness, dumping the inputs in a binary format that can be used by GNATfuzz.
GNATstudio will then setup a fuzzing session on the subprogram, for which the
parameters can be controlled through the various pop-up windows that will be
displayed during the process.

``gnatfuzz`` will periodically export newly found inputs in a human readable
JSON format under ``<obj>/gnattest/test/JSON_Tests``, where ``<obj>`` designates
the object directory of the project.

The fuzzing session will stop once all the stopping criteria have been met. The
fuzzing session can also be stopped early by right clicking on the subprogram
declaration, then selecting ``GNATtest => Start/Stop fuzzing subprogram``.

After the fuzzing sessions has ended, a new GNATtest harness will be
regenerated, including the tests exported by the GNATfuzz session. These will
appear in
``<obj>/gnattest/tests/<unit_name>-test_data-test_<subp_name>_<subp_hash>.adb``,
where ``<unit_name>`` is the name of the unit in which the subprogram is
declared, ``<subp_name>`` is the name of the subprogram, and <subp_hash> is a
hash based on the profile of the subprogram, in order to differentiate
overloads.
