The xcov qualified interface is the synthetic output of the --annotate=report
command line option. The output report shall:

* Start with an explicit "COVERAGE REPORT" indication

* End with an explicit "END OF REPORT" indication

* Feature three sections in between: "Assessment Context",
  "Non-exempted violations" and "Exempted Regions"

* The "Assessment Context" section shall summarize all the elements
  of relevance to characterize the reported assessment unambiguously:

  * Tool version identifier

  * Date and time of execution

  * Full command line issued to produce the report

  * Target criterion

  * Information about each of the input trace files:

    * trace tag & file name,
    * trace production date & time,
    * program executable file name,

* The "Non-exempted violations" section shall

  * List all the target criterion obligations unsatisfied (violated) by the
    set of executions conveyed by the provided execution traces, and

  * End with a count of those violations

* The "Exempted Regions" section shall

  * Summarize information about all the exemption regions in the scope of the
    examined coverage obligations, and

  * End with a count of those regions

**Testing Strategy**

We provide testcases to check that the reports produced by the tool satisfy
the requirements in a range of different situations, with

* Cases where violations get reported from a single execution trace or more,
  validating proper counts of trace file info in their corresponding section
  [SingleTrace, MultipleTraces]

* A case where no violation or exempted region is expected, validating
  the presence of the corresponding sections nevertheless [EmptySections]

We validate the presence and structure of all the expected sections and items
in each testcase. We do not validate the correctness of the section contents
here. That assessment (correctness of the reported violations vs expectations
for particular programs), is defined and validated by sibling chapters of this
qualification material.
