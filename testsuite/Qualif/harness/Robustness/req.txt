The test harness works as intended.

%(tstrategy-headline)s

Check that the harness properly

* detects forced test failures against missing expectations or
  anti-expectations (which state explicitly that no violation is expected to
  be reported)

* deals with irrelevant violations emitted for a test designed for one
  level and exercised for a stricter qualification target
