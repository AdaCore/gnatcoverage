Requirements & Test-Cases Index
===============================

The following table summarizes the requirements and their associated
test-cases, abstracting intermediate groups away.  The *Description* column is
clickable and provides direct access to the artifacts.

The hierarchical structure of the material is such that a given test-case
always participates in the validation of exactly one requirement. The ellipsis
in the *Identification* column for test-cases just stands for the parent
requirement identifier and the table summarizes traceability links in two
directions:

* The test-cases which validate a requirement follow the requirement entry in
  the table, and

* The (single) requirement that a test-case helps validate is the first
  requirement entry that precedes the test-case entry in the table.
