Core expectations for Statement Coverage (SC) assessments. All the other SC
related sections rely on this one.

To ensure coverage of all the relevant language constructs, we decompose the
material further in accordance with a few sections of the chapter 6 “Language”
of the C99 ISO standard:

%(subset-index)s

Other sections of this chapter do not describe C language constructs, or
describe ones that cannot be covered (e.g. Constant expressions), and are
thus not included.
