SC expectations reguarding section 8: Statements and blocks

Specific requirements apply to each possible kind of statement/block of
statements:

%(subset-index)s

Some sub-sections are not included:

-   Labeled statements: those ones yield no code, and thus are not expected to
    be covered.
-   Expression and null statements: null statements obviousl yield no code;
    all expressions kinds have been exercised in a dedicated section.
