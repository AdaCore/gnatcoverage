Exercise a simple SWITCH statement
==================================

Exercise a simple SWITCH statement

Exercise a simple SWITCH statement in the body of a function. Check that:

-   When the function is not called, nothing is covered.
-   When the controlling expression evaluates to a case matched in the nested
    statements, the statements that follow the case label must be covered,
    until a control flow handling statement jumps somewhere else.
-   When the controlling expression evaluates to a value not matched by any
    case label in the nested statements, the statements that follow the default
    label must be covered, until a control flow handling statement jumps
    somewhere else.
