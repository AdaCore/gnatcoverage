Exercise a simple IF statement

Exercise a simple IF statement in the body of a function. Check that:

-   When the function is not called, nothing is covered.
-   When the controlling expression evaluates to true only, the IF statement
    is covered and the statements corresponding to the true outcome are, too.
-   When the controlling expression evaluates to false only, the IF statement
    is covered and the statements corresponding to the false outcome are, too.
-   When the controlling expression evaluates to both true and false, the IF
    statement is covered and the statements corresponding to the true and to
    the false outcome are covered, too.
