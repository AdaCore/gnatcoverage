All C expressions can be used as a statement.

%(tstrategy-headline)s

We exercice every possible kind of expression, as defined by the C99 ISO
standard, in the following situations:

-   no code is run, so all statement-expression must be uncovered
-   code is run partially, so only one out of two statement-expressions must be
    covered
-   code is run fully, so the two statement-expressions must be covered
