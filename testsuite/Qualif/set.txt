This is the root of the "Tool Operational Requirements" and "Testcases"
hierarchy that constitutes part of the GNATcoverage qualification material.
This is decomposed in several toplevel chapters:

==============  ===========================================================
Chapter         Holds material to define and validate expectations w.r.t.
==============  ===========================================================
*report*        the qualified output format
*Ada/*          the source coverage criteria for Ada:
*stmt*          Statement Coverage (SC)
*decision*      Decision Coverage (DC)
*mcdc*          Modified Condition/Decision Coverage (MCDC)
==============  ===========================================================

The SC, DC, and MCDC chapters are those corresponding to the DO-178 structural
coverage criteria. Each chapter adds material (requirements and validating
testcases) on top of the previous ones.

* For a DO-178 level C certification, the SC chapter applies;
* For a DO-178 level B certification, the SC and the DC chapters apply;
* For a DO-178 level A certification, the SC, DC and MCDC chapters apply
