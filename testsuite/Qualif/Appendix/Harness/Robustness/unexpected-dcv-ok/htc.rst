==============================================================

Check that a DC violation does not cause FAILure of a SC test.

Call functional code aimed at "stmt" coverage verification purposes
(category), and featuring a decision. Arrange to achieve stmt coverage only,
exercising the decision only one way, and state absence of violations
expected (because stmt coverage is satisfied).

Test should pass even for qualification level (context) B or A.
