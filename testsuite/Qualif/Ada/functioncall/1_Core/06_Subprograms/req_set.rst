FCC requirements for ARM chap. 6 : Subprograms
==============================================

This is partitioned into several categories:


.. qmlink:: SubsetIndexImporter

   *



While each requirement features a distinct testing strategy, a common scheme
underlies the organization; all the testcases include a variety of
situations, where from some subprograms and calls:

* Some but not all of the code executes,

* All the code executes,

* None of the code executes (subprogram is not called or call is not executed).
