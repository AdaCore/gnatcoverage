When multiple statements share the same line

* Each of them shall be reported uncovered when none of them is executed,

* A single partial coverage indication shall be emitted if at least
  one of them is executed, even if all of them.

**Testing Strategy**

Check cases with

* Straight sequences of statements without conditionals, where
  all or none of the statements get to execute,

* Sequences of statement including conditionals, where all, none
  or some of the statements get to execute.
