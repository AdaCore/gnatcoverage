SC expectations for potentially confusing constructs
=====================================================

SC expectations regarding potentially confusing constructs, e.g. multiple
statements sharing a line.


Requirement(s)
--------------



Statement Coverage assessment remains well defined in the presence of code
constructs that could fool simple minded analysis engines.


Testing Strategy
----------------



Check a panel of cases where code construct particularities could concievably
cause inaccuracies or errors in coverage diagnostics if the tool were to
implement too simple analysis schemes:


.. qmlink:: TCIndexImporter
