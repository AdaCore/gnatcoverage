Statement coverage assessment remains well defined in the presence of code
constructs that could fool simple minded analysis engines.

**Testing Strategy**

* Code indentation could be misleading

* The presence of homonym entities could be misleading

* Multiple statements share the same line

* A single statement spans multiple lines

* Entire sequences are inhibited because nested within a
  conditional statically known to be always False
