Check that coverage is not influenced by statements spanning multiple lines.

Exercise a subprogram which features a single statement spanning multiple
lines. Verify that a single violation designating the first line only is
reported when the statement is not covered (when the subprogram is not
called), and that nothing is reported uncovered otherwise.
