statements spanning multiple lines
==================================

Check that statements spanning multiple lines are handled properly.

Exercise a subprogram containing a single statement spanning multiple
lines. Verify that a single violation designating the first line only is
reported when the statement is not covered (when the subprogram is not
called), and that nothing is reported uncovered otherwise.
