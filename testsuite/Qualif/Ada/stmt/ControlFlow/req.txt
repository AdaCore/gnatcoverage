Material inspired from the SVTAS (Software Verification Tool Assessment Study)
proposals to demonstrate proper processing of statement sequences and various

Statement coverage is assessed correctly for straightline sequences (basic
blocks) of statements and combinations of such constructed with jump-like
control flow transfers (goto, return, raise, exit).
