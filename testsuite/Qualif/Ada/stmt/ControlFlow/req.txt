Statement coverage is assessed correctly for straightline sequences (basic
blocks) and combinations of such constructed with jump-like control flow
transfers (goto, return, raise, exit).

If execution reaches the top of a basic block, no statement in the block is
reported uncovered. Conversely, if execution doesn't reach the top of a basic
block, all the statements in the block are reported uncovered.

**Testing Strategy**

1. Check that basic blocks of statements are recognized in various
   possible contexts:

   * Package elaboration body

   * Subprogram bodies or local block declarations

2. Check that uncommon sequences are handled properly:

   * Very long sequences,

   * Sequences of null or no-op statements (pragmas)

3. Check that various forms of control-flow transfers are handled properly,
   from

   * goto statements, 

   * return statements,
   
   * loop exits,

   * local exception raises,

4. Check correct handling of statements that evaluate only partially, in
   particular with expression shortcircuits.
