Statement coverage is assessed correctly for straightline sequences (basic
blocks) and combinations of such constructed with jump-like control flow
transfers (goto, return, raise, exit).

If execution reaches the top of a basic block, no statement in the block is
reported uncovered. Conversely, if execution doesn't reach the top of a basic
block, all the statements in the block are reported uncovered.

**Testing Strategy**

Check that the tool recognizes sequences in either subprogram or package
elaboration bodies, and properly handles

* Very long sequences of statements,

* Basic blocks of/with null statements,

* Control flow transfers from goto, return, loop exit statements,
  or local exception raises,

* Statements that evaluate only partially, in particular with
  expression shortcircuits.
