Statement coverage should be assessed correctly for exceptions:
- a raise statement shall be reported as covered only when in is actually
  executed;
- if an exception is raised, all the statement of the given frame that have
  not been executed yet, shall be reported as uncovered;
- the code of an exceptions handler shall not be reported as covered if the
  control has not be transferred into the handler as the result of exception
  raise;

Testing strategy notes:
----------------------
Different contexts of exception raising shall be checked (procedure and
function bodies, block statements);

Explicit raise of exception by RAISE statement shall be checked. Implicit
raise of predefined exceptions shall be checked only if general operational
requirements require the code to be compiled with checks for predefined
exceptions ON.

Handlers with explicit exception names and handlers with the OTHERS choice
shall be checked.

One test case may combine more then one cases from above.
