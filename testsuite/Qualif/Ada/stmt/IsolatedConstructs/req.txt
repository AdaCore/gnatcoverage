Statement coverage should be assessed correctly for all the executable
language constructs and language features supported by the compiler version in
question.

Testing strategy notes:
----------------------
- this tool operation requirement is split into subordinate requirements
  according to the language description in the Ada Reference Manual (ARM). The
  Top level of subordinate requirements corresponds to the Chapters of ARM from
  2 to 13:

    Pragmas (the only executable constructs described in Chapter 2 "Lexical
             Elements")
    Declarations_And_Types
    Statements
    Subprograms
    Packages
    Visibility_Rules
    Program_Structure_And_Compilation_Issues
    Exceptions
    Generic_Units
    Representation_Issues

  This list does not contain an element corresponding to Chapter 4
  ("Expressions") because from the statement coverage point of view every
  expression is a part of statement or declaration construct that is subjected
  to statement coverage.

  This list also does not contain an element corresponding to Chapter 9 "Tasks
  and Synchronization" because the corresponding constructs are not supported
  for  ZFP run-time.

- each language feature is checked separately, the only combinations of
  language features used in the tests are those that are needed to create the
  test case for a target construct;

Ongoing development notes:
-------------------------
- At some point subdirectories of LanguageFeatures directory should be moved
  one level up to make up the subhierarchy described above, and
  LanguageFeatures itself should disappear;

- The content of CompoundS and GenericS subdirectories also most probably
  should be merged into the hierarchy described above, and these
  subdirectories should also go away;

- BasicBlocks subdirectory most probably should be kept as is to follow
  guidelines from Software Verification Tools Assessment Study document.
