The code of a generic unit is reported as covered only if the generic is
instantiated, and the instantiation is either called (in case of a subprogram
instantiation or a subprogram declared in generic package) or elaborated (in
case of a declaration or elaboration code in a generic package).

Testing strategy notes:
----------------------
Generic packages and generic subprograms shall be checked.

Library-level generics and locally declared generics shall be checked.

Library-level instantiations and local instantiations shall be checked.

One test case may combine more then one cases from above.
