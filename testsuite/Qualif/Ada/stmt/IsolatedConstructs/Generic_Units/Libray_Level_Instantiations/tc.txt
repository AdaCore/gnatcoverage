Check that in case of a library-level instantiation the code of the generic
unit is not reported as covered if the instantiation is not executed or
elaborated. Check that if a generic unit is not instantiated then its code is
not reported as covered. This test case does not check that the code of
generic unit is reported as uncovered if the unit is not instantiated or if
the instantiation is not executed/elaborated, because for unused generics in
some cases no coverage information is generated.
