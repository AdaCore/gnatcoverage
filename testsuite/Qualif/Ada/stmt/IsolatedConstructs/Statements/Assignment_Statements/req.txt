Statement coverage should be assessed correctly for an assignment statement

Testing strategy notes:
----------------------
An assignment statement is the most common statement in the program code, so
it is checked in many places and contexts. Here we check only very basic usage
of assignment statement to have this language feature systematical covered
by the test suite.

Test cases should include only basic real-life usage of an assignment
statement, such as:
  - procedure body;
  - function body;
  - package body;
