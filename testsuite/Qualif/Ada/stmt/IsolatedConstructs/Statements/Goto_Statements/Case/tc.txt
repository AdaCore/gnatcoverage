Statement coverage shell be assessed correctly for a GOTO statement that is a
part of the statement sequence in a CASE statement path:

- a GOTO statement shell not be reported as covered if the enclosing path of
  the CASE statement is not entered;

- if execution of a GOTO statement transfers the control out of the CASE
  statement path, the statements that follow this GOTO statement in the CASE
  statement path shell be reported as not covered

Testing strategy notes:
----------------------
Test cases shell include CASE statement path with explicit list of choices
and with OTHERS choice. The case with more then one GOTO statement inside a
path should be checked, test case shell cause execution of different GOTO
statements inside the path.

Tests do not have to concentrate on GOTO statements outside CASE statements.
