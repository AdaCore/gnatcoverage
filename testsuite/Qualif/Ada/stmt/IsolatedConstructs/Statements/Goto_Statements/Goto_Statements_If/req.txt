Statement coverage shell be assessed correctly for a GOTO statement that is a
part of the statement sequence in an IF statement path:

- a GOTO statement shell not be reported as covered if the enclosing path of
  the IF statement is not entered;

- if execution of a GOTO statement transfers the control out of the IF
  statement path, the statements that follow this GOTO statement in the IF
  statement path shell be reported as not covered

Testing strategy notes:
----------------------
Test cases shell include different forms of IF statement paths. The case with
more then one GOTO statement inside a path should be checked, test case shell
cause execution of different GOTO statements inside the path.

Tests do not have to concentrate on GOTO statements outside IF statements.
