A GOTO statement shall not be reported as covered if it is a part of a
straight-line statement block and the block is not entered; statements
following a GOTO statement which is executed shall be reported as not covered.

**Testing strategy**

* control transfer inside the same straight-line statement block should be
  checked;

* control transfer back and forward shell be checked;

* control transfer out of immediately enclosing statement sequence shell be
  checked (jumping out of a LOOP, CASE, IF, block statements);

* jumping out of exception handler cannot be checked when the sources are
  compiled with -gnatp;

* when used to transfer control out of a compound statement, GOTO usually
  is enclosed by some conditional statement - otherwise we will get dead code
  that cannot be considered as a normal thing in a real code. When considering
  the case when a GOTO statement transfers control out of something, we
  implicitly assume that this GOTO is a part of some IF statement that
  defines the condition when the control should be transferred.

For enclosing contexts only typical situations shell be considered: procedure
body, function body, generic unit. One test case may combine more then one
cases from above.
