Statement coverage shell be assessed correctly for a GOTO statement that is a
part of a straight-line statement block:

- a GOTO statement shell not be reported as covered if a straight-line
  statement block containing this GOTO statement is not entered;

- if execution of a GOTO statement causes skipping of some statements the
  statements being skipped shell not be reported as covered.

Testing strategy notes:
----------------------
Test cases shell cause execution of each goto statement in functional source
that is under the control of a test driver.
