Statement coverage shell be assessed correctly for a GOTO statement that is a
part of the statement sequence in a LOOP statement:

- a GOTO statement shell not be reported as covered if the enclosing loop is
  not executed or if a loop condition (in case of a conditional loop)
  prevents the first loop iteration.

- if execution of a GOTO statement transfers the control out of the loop
  statement at the first loop iteration, the statements inside the loop
  that follow this GOTO statement should be reported as not covered

Testing strategy notes:
----------------------
Test cases shell include different forms of LOOP statements. The case with
more then one GOTO statement inside a loop should be checked, test case shell
cause execution of different GOTO statements inside the loop.

Tests do not have to concentrate on GOTO statements outside LOOP statements.
