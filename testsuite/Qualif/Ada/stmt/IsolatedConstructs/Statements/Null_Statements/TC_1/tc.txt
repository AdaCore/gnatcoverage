Check various code fragments that contain null statements such as:
\begin{itemize}
\item case statement alternative;
\item null procedure;
\item last statement in a statement sequence that has a label attached to it and
    is used in control transfer to skip the preceding sequence of statements.
\end{itemize}
Check that only those null statements that are not executed are reported as uncovered.
