If a loop statement is executed, but during its first iteration the control is
transferred outside the loop, the rest of the loop component statements are
reported as uncovered. The test driver calls only those subprograms from the
functional code that contain loops with EXIT statements. The statements that
are components of these loop statements and that follow the EXIT statements
are expected to be reported as uncovered, except for the loop statements from
the body of the More_LOOP_Statements package (they are fully executed as a
part of package elaboration, so they and all their component statements are
expected to be reported as covered).
