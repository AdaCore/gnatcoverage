If a conditional loop statement is executed, but the loop condition prevents
even the first loop iteration then all the statement that are the components
of this loop are reported as uncovered (whereas the loop itself is reported as
covered). The test driver calls only those subprograms from the functional
code that contain conditional loops. The statements that are components of
these loop statements are expected to be reported as uncovered, except for the
loop statements from the body of the More_LOOP_Statements package (they are
fully executed as a part of package elaboration, so they  and all their
component statements are expected to be reported as covered).
