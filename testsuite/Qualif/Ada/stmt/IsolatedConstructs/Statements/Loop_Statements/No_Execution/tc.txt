If a loop statement is not executed, then the loop statement itself and all of
its components are reported as uncovered. The test driver only "with"s the
functional code, but it does not execute anything from it. All the loop
statements from the functional code and components thereof are expected to be
reported as uncovered, except the loop statements from the body of the
More_LOOP_Statements package (they are fully executed as a part of package
elaboration, so they and all their component statements are expected to be
reported as covered).
