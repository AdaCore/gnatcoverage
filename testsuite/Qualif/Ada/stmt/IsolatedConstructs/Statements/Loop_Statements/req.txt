If a loop statement is not executed, the statement itself and all its
components shall be reported as uncovered (Test case No_Execution).

If a conditional loop is executed, but the loop condition prevents the first
loop iteration, all the loop component statements shall be reported as
uncovered. (Test case No_Iteration).

If a loop statement is executed, but the control transfer out of the loop
takes place during the first loop iteration, then the rest of the loop
component statements shall be reported as uncovered. (Test case
Incomplete_Iteration).

If a loop statement is executed and at least one complete loop iteration
happens as a part of the execution, the loop statement and none of its
component statements shall be reported as uncovered (Test case Full_Iteration)

Testing strategy:

Different syntax forms of LOOP statement shall be checked:
\begin{itemize}
\item FOR loop;
\item reverse FOR loop;
\item WHILE loop;
\item unconditional loop.
\end{itemize}

The tests should not concentrate on different ways of transferring control
out of the LOOP statements (such as EXIT statements and GOTO statements),
because these control statement are tested separately. Only some basic usage
of EXIT statement shall be checked.
