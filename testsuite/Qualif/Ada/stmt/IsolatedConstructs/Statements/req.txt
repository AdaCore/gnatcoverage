Statement coverage should be assessed correctly for all the basic Ada
statement constructs. Basic Ada constructs are constructs described in Chapter
5 "Statements" of the Ada Reference Manual

Testing strategy notes:
----------------------
- this tool operation requirement is split into subordinate requirements
  according to the sections of Chapter 5 of ARM:
     5.1 Simple and Compound Statements - Sequences of Statements
         (Actually, the only thing to check here if the coverage of null
         statement)
     5.2 Assignment Statements
     5.3 If Statements
     5.4 Case Statements
     5.5 Loop Statements
     5.6 Block Statements
     5.7 Exit Statements
     5.8 Goto Statements

- the goal of this part of the test suite is to check that a given statement
  and its components are correctly reported as covered (or non-covered) by
  the coverage tool, but not to check any combinations of statements or any
  interrelation between statements. See Basic Block part for statement
  sequences and transfer control issues.

- there is no need in complex test cases here or in various test case for a
  specifies statement king, except for control statements (IF, CASE and LOOP).
  For simple (non-control) statement we check only coverage, for control
  statements we have to check that the right part of statement is reported as
  covered or non-covered. All that should be done is to check that for
  a given statement kind coverage is correctly accessed for a typical usage of
  the statement in typical contexts.
