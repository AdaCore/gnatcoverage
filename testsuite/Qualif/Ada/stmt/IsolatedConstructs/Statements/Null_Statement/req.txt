Statement coverage should be assessed correctly for a null statement

Testing strategy notes:
----------------------
Test cases should include only real-life usage of a null statement, such as:
  - case statement alternative;
  - null procedure;
  - last statement in a statement sequence that has a label attached to it and
    is used in control transfer to skip the preceding sequence of statements.
