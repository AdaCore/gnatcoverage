A block statement is a compound statement. It contains others statements and
(optionally) declarations and exception handlers as its components. A block
statement itself is not a subject of coverage analysis (no coverage
information is generated for the block statement itself, all the information
is generated for its components). If executuon does not reach a block
statement, all its components shall be reported as uncovered.

Testing strategy:

Block statement with and without declarative part, with and without exception
handlers shall be checked.

Tests for a block statement are not supposed to check the case of
transferring the control from outside the statement sequence of the block
statement, this shall be checked for control statements and exception raising.
Coverage of statements in exception handler also is not checked, it shall be
checked for exceptions.
