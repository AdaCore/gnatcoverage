Statement coverage shell be assessed correctly for a block statement. A block
statement is not a control statement, so proper coverage in case of a block
statement means that  if a block statement is a part of straight-line
statement sequence  and the secuence is not entered, block statement and
components thereof shell not be reported as covered.

Testing strategy notes:
----------------------
Block statement with and without declarative part, with and without exception
handlers should be checked.

Tests for a block statement shell not check the case of transferring the
control from outside the statement sequence of the block statement, this shell
be checked for control statements and exception raising. Coverage of
statements in exception handler also is not checked, it shell be checked for
exceptions.

For enclosing contexts only typical situations shell be considered:
  - procedure body;
  - function body;
  - generic subprogram;

One test case may combine more then one cases from above.
