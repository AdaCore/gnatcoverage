Verify that if an IF statement is executed, and its ElSIF path is chosen, then
this path and all its component statements are reported as covered, the IF
path and all the preceding ELSIF path (if any) are reported as covered, but
their components are reported as uncovered, and all the paths that follows
this ELSIF path (if any) and components thereof are reported as uncovered. The
test drivers execute the functional code in such a way that ELSIF paths are
chosen for IF statements contained in the code (so IF statements without ELSIF
path are not executed at all). For an IF statement with multiple ELSIF path
dest drivers execute different ELSIF paths. The exception is the IF statement
from the elaboration code in the body of the More_IF_Statements package (its
IF path is executed as a part of package elaboration, so this path and its
component statements is expected to be reported as covered, and the rest of
this IF statement - as uncovered)
