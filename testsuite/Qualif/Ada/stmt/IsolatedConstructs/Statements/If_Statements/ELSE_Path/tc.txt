Check that if an IF statement is executed, and its ElSE path is chosen, then
all component statements of this ELSE path are reported as covered, and for all
the preceding paths, the path itself is reported as covered, but its component
statements are reported as uncovered. The test driver executes only those IF
statements from the functional code that contain ELSE path and it does this in
such a way that ELSE paths are chosen. This includes the case of an IF
statement that contains only an IF path - the test driver executes it in such
a way that this IF path is not chosen, this is considered as execution of an
implicit ELSE path that contain no statement. The exception is the IF
statement from the elaboration code in the body of the More_IF_Statements
package (its IF path is executed as a part of package elaboration, so this
path and its component statements is expected to be reported as covered, and
the rest of this IF statement - as uncovered)
