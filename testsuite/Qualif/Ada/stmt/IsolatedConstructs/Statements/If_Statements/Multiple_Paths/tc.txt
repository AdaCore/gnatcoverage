Verify that if all the path of an IF statement are executed, then no path and
no component statement is reported as uncovered. The test driver executes the
functional code in such a way that all the paths of all the IF statements are
executed, it calls subprograms from the functional code several times to do
that. The exception is the IF statement from the elaboration code in the body
of the More_IF_Statements package (its IF path is executed as a part of
package elaboration, so this path and its component statements is expected to
be reported as covered, and the rest of this IF statement - as uncovered)
