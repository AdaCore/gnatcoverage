Statement coverage should be assessed correctly for an IF statement

Testing strategy notes:
----------------------
When checking coverage for an IF statement, the tests should check that the
statement as a whole is covered as well as statements in the path chosen
depending on computing the conditions in IF and ELSIF paths.

Different syntax forms of IF statement should be checked:
   - simplest form - no ELSE path, no ELSIF path;
   - multiple ELSIF paths;
   - ELSE path with and without ELSIF path;
   - ELSIF paths with and without ELSE path;

For enclosing contexts only typical situations should be considered:
  - procedure body;
  - function body;
  - generic unit;
  - package body;

One test case may combine more then one cases from above.
