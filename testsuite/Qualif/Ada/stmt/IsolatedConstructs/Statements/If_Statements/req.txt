An IF statement contains more then one execution path (counting implicit empty path for an IF statement without ELSE and ELSIF paths), and an execution of an IF statement executes exactly one path.

If an IF statement is not executed, the all its paths and all their component
statements shall be reported as uncovered (Test case No_Execution).

If an IF statement is executed, and its IF path is chosen, then the IF path
and all its components shall be reported as covered, and all the other paths
and components thereof shall be reported as uncovered (Test case IF_Path).

If an IF statement is executed, and one of its ELSIF path is chosen, then such ELSIF path and all its components shall be reported as covered. Preceding ELSIF paths shall be reported as covered, but their components shall be reported as uncovered; the IF path, all other ELSEIF (if any) and the ELSEIF path (if any) shall be reported as uncovered.

If an IF statement is executed, and its ElSE path is chosen, then the
components of this ELSE path shall be reported as covered. The IF path and
ELSIF paths (if any) that precede the ELSE path shall be reported as covered,
but all the components thereof shall be reported as uncovered (Test case
ELSE_Path).

If an IF statement is executed several times, and different paths of this
statement are chosen by different executions, then all the executed paths and
components thereof shall be reported as covered (Test Case Multiple_Paths)

Testing strategy:

Different syntax forms of IF statement should be checked:
\begin{itemize}
\item simplest form - no ELSE path, no ELSIF path;
\item multiple ELSIF paths;
\item ELSE path with and without ELSIF path;
\item ELSIF paths with and without ELSE path.
\end{itemize}
