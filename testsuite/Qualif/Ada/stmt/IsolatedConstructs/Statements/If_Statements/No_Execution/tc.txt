Check that if an IF statement is not executed, then all its paths and all its
component statements are reported as uncovered. The test driver only "with"s
the functional code, but it does not execute anything from it. All the IF
statements from the functional code and components thereof are expected to be
reported as uncovered. The exception is the IF statement from the elaboration
code in the body of the More_IF_Statements package (its IF path is executed as
a part of package elaboration, so this path and its component statements is
expected to be reported as covered, and the rest of this IF statement - as
uncovered)
