Statement coverage should be assessed correctly for a CASE statement

Testing strategy notes:
----------------------
When checking coverage for a CASE statement, the tests should check that the
statement as a whole is covered as well as statements in the path chosen
depending on case expression.

Different syntax forms of IF statement should be checked:
   - with and without OTHERS choice;
   - choices defined by an expression and by a range;
   - choices containing one value and multiple values;

For enclosing contexts only typical situations should be considered:
  - procedure body;
  - function body;
  - generic unit;
  - package body;

One test case may combine more then one cases from above.
