Statement coverage shall be correctly assessed for the code from subunits.

Testing strategy notes:
----------------------
The only thing from Chapter 10 ("Program Structure and Compilation Issues")
from the Ada Language Reference Manual that needs a special attention is
subunits. All the other aspects described in this Chapter are addressed by all
the tests from Isolated_Constructs part.

Both subprogram and package subunits shall be checked.

More then one level of subunits shall be checked.
