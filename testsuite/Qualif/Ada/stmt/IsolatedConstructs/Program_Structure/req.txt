The only element from Chapter 10 ("Program Structure and Compilation Issues")
from the Ada Language Reference Manual that needs a special attention is
subunits. All the other aspects described in this Chapter are addressed by all
the tests from Isolated_Constructs part.

The nesting level of subprograms and subunits shall not influence their coverage.

Testing strategy notes:
----------------------
Both subprogram and package subunits shall be checked.
More then one level of subunits shall be checked.
