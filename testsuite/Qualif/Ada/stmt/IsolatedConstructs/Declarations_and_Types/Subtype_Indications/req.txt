A subtype indication that contains a range, index or discriminant constraint
may generate a coverage information. If such subtype indication is not
elaborated it shall be reported as uncovered. If it is elaborated it shall not
be reported as uncovered.

Testing strategy:

Tests shall use subtype indications in such a way that the subtype indication
shall be the only reason to generate coverage information to avoind masking of
subtype indication coverage with coverage information generating for another
construct. For example, if a subtype indication is a part of an object
declaration, then this declaration shall not contain an initialization
expression. Subtype indication shall be checked when used in:
\begin{itemize}
\item subtype declarations;
\item object declarations;
\item component declarations;
\end{itemize}
