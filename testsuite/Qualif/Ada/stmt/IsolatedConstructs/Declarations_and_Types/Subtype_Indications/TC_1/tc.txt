Check that a declaration that contains a subtype indication is reported as
uncovered if the declaration is not elaborated, and it does not reported as
uncovered if the declaration is elaborated. 

Tests use subtype indications in such a way that the subtype indication
shall be the only reason to generate coverage information to avoind masking of
subtype indication coverage with coverage information generating for another
construct. For example, if a subtype indication is a part of an object
declaration, then this declaration does not contain an initialization
expression. 

Subtype indication are checked when used in:
 * subtype declarations;
 * object declarations;
 * component declarations;
