This test case checks that object declaration containing subtype indication
with discriminant constraint and having a component depending on discriminant
is treated as statement for coverage analysis purposes. Object declaration
do not contain explicit initialization, and object types does not define any
default initialization (except for discriminant component, but this default
initialization does not have any effect because of explicit discriminant
constraint).
