An object declaration shall be reported as covered only if it is elaborated.

Testing strategy notes:

- Different kinds of object declarations may result in elaboration code
  that can be subjected to coverage analysis. At least following cases shall
  be checked:
        1. Variable object declaration with explicit initialization
           expression;
        2. Constant object declaration with explicit initialization expression;
        3. Objects of scalar, array, record and access types;
        4. Objects of private types;
        5. Implicit initialization of record objects
        6. Implicit initialization of access objects (by null value);
        7. Objects of derived record types with implicit initialization.
  One test case may cover more then one of the positions in the list above.
