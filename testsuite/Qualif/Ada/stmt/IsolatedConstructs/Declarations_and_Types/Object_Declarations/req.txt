If an object declaration is elaborated it shall be reported as uncovered. If
an object declaration is elaborated it shall not be reported as uncovered.

Testing strategy:

Not all the object declarations are reported as covered or uncovered. Tests
shall check at least the following kinds of object declarations that for sure
have elaboration code associated with them:

- object declarations with explicit initialization expressions;
- declarations of objects whose types define implicit initialization (this
  includes record types and access types);

A separate declaration sequence shall be used for each object declaration of
interest, and the tested declaration shall be the first declaration in the
sequence that has a coverage information associated with it.
