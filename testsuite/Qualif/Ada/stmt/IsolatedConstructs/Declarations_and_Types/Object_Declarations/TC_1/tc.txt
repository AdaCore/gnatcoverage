Check that an object declaration is reported as uncovered if it is not
elaborated, and that it is not reported as uncovered if it is elaborated.

Check  the following kinds of object declarations that for sure
have elaboration code associated with them:

 * object declarations with explicit initialization expressions;
 * declarations of objects whose types define implicit initialization (this
  includes record types and access types).

Check local and global declarations, declarations located in functions and in
subprograms. Check objects of different kinds.
