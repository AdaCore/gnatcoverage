A discrete subtype definition that contains a range may generate a coverage
information. If such discrete subtype definition is not elaborated it shall be
reported as uncovered. If it is elaborated it shall not be reported as
uncovered.

Testing strategy:

Tests shall use discrete subtype definition in such a way that this discrete
subtype definition shall be the only reason to generate coverage information
to avoid masking of subtype indication coverage with coverage information
generating for another construct.
