If a declaration is not elaborated as a part of the program execution it shall
be reported as uncovered.

Testing strategy:

Not all the declarations result in elaboration code.Different declaration
kinds resulted in elaboration code shall be checked.

This requirement is further split into the subordinate requirements as
follows. These subrequirements does not follow the structure of the Chapter 3
of the Ada Reference Manual, instead they aggregate situations and declaration
kinds that are of interest for coverage analysis.

- Object_Declarations: they may have the executable code associated with
  them in case if implicit or explicit initialization is provided for the
  object;

- Subtype_Indications: if a subtype indication contains a constraint, its
  elaboration may need executable code. Subtype indication shall be checked in
  different contexts (including type and subtype declarations, and object
  declarations);

- Discrete_Subtype Definitions: they are similar to range constraints, but
  are used in constrained array type definitions.

- Variant_Parts: these constructs are of special interest for object
  coverage because they are in some sense equivalent to case statements -
  depending om discriminant values, different elaboration sequences can be
  chosen for the record definition containing a variant part;

- Declaration_Sequences: a declaration sequence is similar to a straitline
  statement sequence for coverage analysis purposes.
