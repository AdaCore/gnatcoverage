Check that when an object of variant record type is created and elaboration of
the object declaration includes evaluation of default initialization
expressions for components defined in variant part then only the code executed
as the result of evaluating expressions in variants corresponding to
discriminant values is reported as covered, and the code that can be called
from other variants is reported as uncovered. Test drivers create record
object with different discrimnant values.
