Statement coverage shall be assessed correctly for the situation when
an object for a record type with variant part is created. This means the
following. The declaration of a record type with variant part is not a subject
of coverage analysis by its own, because no coverage information is generated
for it. But the variant part works like an implicit case statement when an
object of a variant part is created. When a specific variant is chosen for the
discriminant(s) value(s) specified, the corresponding initialization
expression (if any) is evaluated. This expression evaluation may result in
function call, that is, in execution of some piece of code that does not have
an explicit connection to the place of the object declaration.

If creation of an object of the variant record type may result in execution of
different code fragments for different variants, then only the code executed
from the variant actually chosen shall be reported as covered, and all the
other code that can be called from elaborating of other variants shall be
reported as uncovered.
