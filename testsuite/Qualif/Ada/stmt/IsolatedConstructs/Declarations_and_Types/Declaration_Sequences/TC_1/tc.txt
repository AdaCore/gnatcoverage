Check that when a declaration sequence is elaborated, no declaration from it
is reported as uncovered, and the other way around - when a declaration
sequence is not elaborated, no declaration from it is reported as covered. The
test drivers "with" the library package with the functional code, so
library-level declarations are always elaborated. Some of the drivers
instantiate generic from the functional code to check the elaboration of a
declaration sequence in the instantiation. Some of the drivers call a local
subprogram to check elaboration of a local declaration sequence
