If a declaration sequence is elaborated, no declaration from this sequence
shall be reported as uncovered. If a declaration sequence is not elaborated,
no declaration from this sequence shall be reported as covered.

Testing strategy:

A declaration sequence is similar to a straitline statement sequence. No
transfer control can happen when elaborating the declaration sequence (the
qualificed profile allows only explicit exception raise, so no predefined
exception can be raises as a part of elaboration), so the sequence is either
elaborated or not elaborated.

Different kinds of declarations shall be checked. Different contexts of
declaration sequences shall be checked.
