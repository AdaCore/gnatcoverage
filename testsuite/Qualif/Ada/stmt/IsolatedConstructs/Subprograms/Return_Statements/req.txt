Return statement shall be reported as covered only when it is actually
executed. If a return statement is executed, then all the statements in a
subprogram body that have not been executed by this moment shall be reported
as uncovered.

Testing strategy notes:
----------------------
Return statements in procedure and in function bodies shall be checked.

The case when a subprogram body contains more then one return statement shall
be checked.

One test case may combine more then one cases from above.
