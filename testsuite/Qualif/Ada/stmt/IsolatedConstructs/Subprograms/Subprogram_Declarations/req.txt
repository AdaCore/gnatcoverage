Subprogram declarations shall never be reported as covered because they do not
contain executable code. No code from subprogram body shall be reported as
covered if the subprogram is never called.

Testing strategy notes:
----------------------
Library-level subprograms, subprograms declared in library packages and local
subprograms shall be checked.

Different ways of subprogram calls shall be checked:
  - ordinary calls by means of a call statement/function call expression;
  - dynamic calls through access-to-subprogram value;
  - implicit calls as the result of evaluation of default initialization
    expressions;

One test case may combine more then one cases from above.
