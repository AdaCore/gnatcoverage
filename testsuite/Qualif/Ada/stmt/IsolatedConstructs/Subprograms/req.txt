Statement coverage shall be assessed correctly for Ada subprogram constructs
according to the semantics of these constructs as described in Chapter 6
"Subprograms" of the Ada Reference Manual.

Testing strategy notes:
----------------------
- this tool operation requirement is split into subordinate requirements:
  - Subprogram Declarations (and subprogram body declarations): the goal is to
    check that the code from these constructs is reported as covered only when
    a subprogram is called
  - Return Statements: the goal is to check that the return statement is
    reported as covered only if it is actually executed, and that the
    statements that are skipped as the result of execution of the return
    statement are not reported as covered;
  - Derived Subprograms: the goal is to check that in case of the calls to
    implicit inherited subprograms the coverage information is assessed
    correctly for an explicit subprogram this implicit subprogram is inherited
    from;
  - Inline Expansion of subprograms: the goal is to verify that inline
    expansion does not result of any problem in computation coverage
    information for the language constructs and aspects mentioned above;

- the tests from this part of the test suite are not supposed to check any
  deeply nested subprogram structures;

- the tests from this part of the test suite are not supposed to check
  coverage for any statements (except the RETURN statement) and/or other
  constructs enclosed by subprogram bodies;
