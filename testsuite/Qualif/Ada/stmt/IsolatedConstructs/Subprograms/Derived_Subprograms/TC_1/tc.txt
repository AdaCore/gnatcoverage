Check that for inherited subprograms, the code of a user-defined subprogram is
reported as uncovered if neither this subprogram nor any subprogram inherited
from  it (directly or indirectly) is called. Check that call to overriding
subprogram does not result in reporting the code of overridden subprogram as
covered.

The functional code includes more then one level of inheritance. Test drivers
call inherited subprograms in different ways, including dispatching calls,
calls through access-to-subprogram value and calls resulted from evaluating of
default expressions.
