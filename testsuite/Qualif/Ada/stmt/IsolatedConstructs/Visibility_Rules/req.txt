This part of the test suite covers language features described in Chapter 8
"Visibility Rules" of the Ada Language Reference manual. The only language
feature from Chapter 8 that may directly affect computing coverage information
if renaming declaration. Coverage shall be assessed correctly for renaming
declarations and for other constructs they can affect.

Testing strategy notes:
----------------------
- Two kinds of renaming declarations are of interest for coverage - object
  renamings and subprogram renamings. They shall be tested separately;

- For object renaming declarations, it shall be checked that:
  - a renaming declaration is reported as covered only if it is elaborated;
  - if renamed object contains a function call as a part of its evaluation, the
    code of the corresponding function is reported as covered only if the
    renaming declaration is elaborated;

- For a subprogram renaming, it shall be checked that:
  - elaboration of subprogram renaming declaration does not result in
    reporting the code of the subprogram as covered (if the subprogram is not
    called);
  - the code of the renamed subprogram is reported as covered if the subprogram
    is called using the new name introduced by the renaming declaration;
