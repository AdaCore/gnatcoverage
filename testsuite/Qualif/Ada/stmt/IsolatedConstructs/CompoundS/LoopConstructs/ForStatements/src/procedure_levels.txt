To verify coverage of loop/exit statements, we implement two functions
featuring such constructs, exercize them in various ways and verify that all
and only those statements expected uncovered are reported as such.

The two functions implement very simple services over integer Levels and
sample arrays of such. Both functions iterate over samples using a 'for'
statement. The second one features an exit statement as well.
