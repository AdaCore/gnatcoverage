The only element from Chapter 10 ("Program Structure and Compilation Issues")
from the Ada Language Reference Manual that needs a special attention for
coverage analysis is subunits.

Coverage shall be assessed correctly for the code in subunits. The nesting
level of subprograms and subunits shall not influence their coverage.

**Testing strategy**

Both subprogram and package subunits shall be checked.
More then one level of subunits shall be checked.
