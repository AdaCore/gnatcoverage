Check that if no RAISE statement is executed that all of them and all the code
in all the exception handlers are reported as uncovered. Check that if a RAISE
statement is executed, then this statement and statements from the handler
corresponding to the exception being raised are not reported as uncovered.

The functional code contains RAISE statements in different contexts:
procedure and function bodies, block statements.

The functional code contains exception handlers with explicit exception names
and handlers with the OTHERS choice.

Explicit raise of exception by RAISE statement shall be checked. Implicit
raise of predefined exceptions shall be checked only if general operational
requirements require the code to be compiled with checks for predefined
exceptions ON.
