Statement coverage is assessed correctly for exception mechanism. This means
that:

 * a RAISE statement shall be reported as uncovered if it is not executed. The
   statements from exception handlers shall be reported as uncovered if no
   exception is raised.

 * if a RAISE statement id executed, all the statements of the given frame that
   have not been executed yet, shall be reported as uncovered.

 * if an exception is raised and then handled, only the statements from the
   handler corresponding to the exception shall be reported as covered,
   statements from all the other exception handlers shall be reported as
   uncovered.
