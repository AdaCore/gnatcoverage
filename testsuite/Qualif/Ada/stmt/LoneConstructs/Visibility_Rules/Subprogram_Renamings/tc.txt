Check that renaming of a subprogram does not cause by itself the code of the
renamed subprogram to be reported as covered. That is, if the renamed
subprogram is not called using its original name or the name defined by
renaming declaration, its code shall be reported as uncovered. If a subprogram
is called by using any of the names defined for it, its code shall not be
reported as uncovered.

Test drivers check procedure and function renamings that are done at library
level and that are local.
