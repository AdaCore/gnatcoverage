Statement coverage shall be assessed correctly for Ada subprogram constructs
according to the semantics of these constructs as described in Chapter 6
"Subprograms" of the Ada Reference Manual.

Testing strategy:
This tool operation requirement is split into subordinate requirements:

 * Subprogram_Declarations: the code from a subprogram body shall be
   reported as uncovered if a subprogram is never called;

 * Return_Statements: the RETURN statement shall be reported as uncovered
   if it is not executed; if the RETURN statement is executed then all the
   statements that are skipped as the result of execution of the return
   statement shall be reported as uncovered;

 *  Derived_Subprograms: a call to implicit inherited subprogram shall result
    in generating the correct coverage information for an explicit subprogram
    this implicit subprogram is inherited from;

 *  Inline_Expansion: inline expansion shall not result in any problem in
    computation coverage information for the language constructs and aspects
    mentioned above;
