In case of implicit inherited subprograms, the code of the explicit subprogram
it is inherited from shall be reported as uncovered if neither the explicit
subprogram nor any of implicit subprogram inherited from it is called. In case
of the call to overriding subprogram, the code of the overridden subprogram
shall be reported as uncovered if this overridden subprogram is not covered
by itself.

Testing strategy notes:
----------------------
More then one level of inheritance shall be checked.

Dispatching calls shall be checked.

Different ways of subprogram calls shall be checked:
  - ordinary calls by means of a call statement/function call expression;
  - dynamic calls through access-to-subprogram value;
  - implicit calls as the result of evaluation of default initialization
    expressions;

One test case may combine more then one cases from above.
