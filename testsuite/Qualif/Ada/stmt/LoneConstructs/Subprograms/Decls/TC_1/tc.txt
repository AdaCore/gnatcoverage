Check that the code from a subprogram body is reported as uncovered if a
subprogram is never called. Check that (at least some part of) the code from a
subprogram body is not reported as uncovered if the subprogram is called at
least once.

The functional code contains:

* library-level subprograms;
* subprograms declared in library packages;
* and local subprograms;

Test drivers use different ways of calling subprograms from the functional
code:

* ordinary calls by means of a call statement/function call expression;
* dynamic calls through access-to-subprogram value;
* implicit calls as the result of evaluation of default initialization expressions;
