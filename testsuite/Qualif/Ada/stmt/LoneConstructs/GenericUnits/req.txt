The code of a generic unit shall be reported as covered only if the generic is
instantiated, and the instantiation is either called (in case of a subprogram
instantiation or a subprogram declared in generic package) or elaborated (in
case of a declaration or elaboration code in a generic package). In all the
other cases the code from a generic unit shall be reported as uncovered

**Testing strategy**

Generic packages and generic subprograms shall be checked.

Library-level generics and locally declared generics shall be checked.

Library-level instantiations and local instantiations shall be checked.
