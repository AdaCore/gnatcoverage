A declaration sequence is similar to a straitline statement sequence. No
transfer control can happen when elaborating the declaration sequence (the
qualificed profile allows only explicit exception raise, so no predefined
exception can be raises as a part of elaboration), so the sequence is either
elaborated or not elaborated.

Check that when a declaration sequence is elaborated, no declaration from it
is reported as uncovered, and the other way around - when a declaration
sequence is not elaborated, no declaration from it is reported as covered. The
test drivers "with" the library package with the functional code, so
library-level declarations are always elaborated. Some of the drivers
instantiate generic from the functional code to check the elaboration of a
declaration sequence in the instantiation. Some of the drivers call a local
subprogram to check elaboration of a local declaration sequence
