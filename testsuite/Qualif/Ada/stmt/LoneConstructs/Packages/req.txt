Code of the package including statements in the package body shall be reported
as covered only when the package is elaborated.

Testing strategy notes:
----------------------
Library packages and local packages shall be checked. The only situation when
code from a package body shall be reported as uncovered is when a local
package is declared in a subprogram body.
