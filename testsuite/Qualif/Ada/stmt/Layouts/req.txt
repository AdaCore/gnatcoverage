Statement coverage assessment is well defined for common programming style
artifacts that decouple statements from indivdual source lines, in particular
when:

- A single statement spans multiple lines

- Multiple statements appear on a single line

In addition, statement coverage assessment remains correct in the presence of
code constructs that could fool simple minded analysis engines, in particular:

 - Overloading which could lead to confusion between the coverage of/within
   some entity with the coverage of/within another entity of the same name;

 - Indentations which may lead to wrong evaluation of whether code
   is conditioned or not.
