Exempted regions shall all be synthesized in a distinct section of the output
report, with a single message per region. This report section shall not
contain any other kind of message.

Each exemption message exposes the range of source locations covered by the
region decalaration, and indicates whether 0 or more coverage violations were
actually exempted within this range.

Exemption regions shall not influence the diagnostics emitted on constructs
outside of them.

Exemption regions may be declared to exempt various levels of syntactic
constructs such as statements or subprograms, and groups of such in all the
contexts where they may appear.

** Testing strategy: **

For every single stated expectation, the testsuite driver checks if it
appears in the report section expected for it's kind (exempted region or
non-exempted violation).

Check that expected results are produced for exemption regions declared
to encompass 

 * the whole of a procedure body,

 * groups of statements within
    the root sequence of a subprogram body,
    a local exception handler,
    a package body elaboration code, generic case included,

 * a group of entire subprograms,

 * a mix of statements and declarations in a package spec + body
