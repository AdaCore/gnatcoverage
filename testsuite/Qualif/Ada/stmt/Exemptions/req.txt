Material to define and validate the expected processing of exemption regions.

%(reqs-headline)s

Proper behavior of the Coverage Exemptions facility translates into
multiple expectations:

1. Exempted regions shall all be synthesized in a distinct section of the
   output report, with a single message per region.

2. Each exemption message shall expose the range of source locations covered
   by the region declaration, and indicate whether 0 or more coverage
   violations were actually exempted within this range.

3. Exemption regions shall not influence the diagnostics emitted on constructs
   outside of them.

4. The report section dedicated to exemption regions shall not contain any
   other kind of information.

5. Exemption regions may be declared to exempt various levels of syntactic
   constructs such as statements or subprograms, and groups of such in all the
   contexts where they may appear.

We validate all the aspects of this requirement with a set of testcases,
subdivided in sections according to point #5 - demonstrate ability to exempt
various groups of syntactic constructs:

%(tc-index)s

Each test features some mix of exempted regions and regular code, exercised in
multiple manners to cover well identified sections of the program. All the
other aspects of the requirement (points #1 to #4) are validated by the fact
that all the tests run as expected.

For every single stated expectation, exempted region or non-exempted
violation, the testsuite driver checks if it appears in the report section
expected for it's kind (in addition to the regular expected/reported match
checks).
