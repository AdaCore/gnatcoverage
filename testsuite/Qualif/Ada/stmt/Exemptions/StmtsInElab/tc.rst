exemptions applying to groups of statements within a package body elaboration sequence
=======================================================================================

Check processing of exemptions applying to groups of statements within a
package body elaboration sequence, in both a regular and a generic package.

Exercise a regular or instanciated package which exposes a non-exempted
subprogram and an exemption region for a conditioned set of statements within
the package elaboration sequence.
