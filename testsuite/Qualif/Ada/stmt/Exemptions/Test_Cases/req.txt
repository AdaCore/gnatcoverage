Exemption sections shall not affect the coverage information produced by
Xcov, uncovered code from the exemption sections shall be correctly
represented in the exemption section of the report file.

Testing strategy notes:
----------------------
The following shall be checked:

- if a construct is a part of an exemption section and the construct is not
  executed/elaborated, then:
  - the construct shall be reported as uncovered by Xcov;
  - the construct shall be reported as uncovered in the exemption section of
    the report file (fin the corresponding justification ??? can the test
    infrastructure check this???)

- if the code contains exemption section(s), and if a construct is not a part
  of an exemption section, then, when the construct is not
  executed/elaborated, this construct shall be reported of non-exemption
  section of the report file;

- if a construct is a part of an exemption section and the construct is
  executed/elaborated, then it shall be reported as covered by Xcov and it
  shall not be mentioned in the report file (???).

This can be formulated as three separate subordinate requirements, but they
are checked by the same functional code, and each test contains featers
related to different requirements, so they are kept as test strategy notes,
but not requirements.

Tests shall contain exemption sections in statement sequences and in
declaration parts, the case when a compilation unit contain more then one
exemption section shall be checked. No need to go through all possible
statement and declaration kinds here.
