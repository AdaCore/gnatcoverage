Everything inside Subprograms: does it makes sense at all?

others/Subunits

Generics: what does it happen if a generic is not instantiated?

WHAT ABOUT INLINED SUBPROGRAMS?

TO DO:

* CompoundStateemtns/Block is a testcase, not a requirement
* SimpleStatements/Goto is a requirement, not a testcase
* missing text for miscellaneous/req.txt
* collapse object and subprogram remaining into a single testcase in miscellaneous
* Split exceptions into 2 testcases, one for raise, one for exception handler
