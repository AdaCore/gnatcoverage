The only element from Chapter 10 ("Program Structure and Compilation Issues")
from the Ada Language Reference Manual that needs a special attention for
coverage analysis is subunits.

Check that the fact that the code is located in a subunit does not affect
generating coverage information. Functional code contains some typical code
patterns placed in subunits, and test drivers execute different parts of this
code.

Both subprogram and package subunits are checked. More then one level of
subunits is checked.
