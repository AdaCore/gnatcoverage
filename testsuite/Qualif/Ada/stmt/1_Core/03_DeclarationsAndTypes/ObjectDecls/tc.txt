Check SC of Object Declarations

Check that an object declaration is reported as uncovered iif it is not
elaborated. Exercise object declarations for which we expect to have implicit
execution of code for the initializations:

* Object declarations with explicit initialization expressions;

* Declarations of objects whose types define implicit initialization (access
  types and record types with component initializers).

Check local and global declarations.
