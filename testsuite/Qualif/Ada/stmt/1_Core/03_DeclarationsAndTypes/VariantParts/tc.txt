Check SC assessments over Variant Parts in record type declarations.

The variant part of a variant record type declaration declaration of a record
works like an implicit case statement when an object of a variant part is
created. When a specific variant is chosen for the discriminant(s) value(s)
specified, the corresponding initialization expression (if any) is
evaluated. This expression evaluation may result in function call, that is, in
execution of some piece of code that does not have an explicit connection to
the place of the object declaration.

Check that only the code associated to the chosen variant is reported as
covered, including the code of initialization expressions (if any).
