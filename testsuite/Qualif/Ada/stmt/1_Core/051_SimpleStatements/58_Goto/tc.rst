Goto statements (ARM 5.8)
=========================

Check SC with Goto statements (ARM 5.8)

Check that Exit statements are reported covered when execution reaches them,
or uncovered otherwise, and that their control-flow effects are handled
correctly.

Exercise backward and forward transfers of control within:

* straight sequences of statements
* block, case, if or loop statements
