**Exercise SC on a variety of situations involving raise operations**

Exercise procedures and functions including conditional raise
statements for predefined or user defined exceptions, all handled
locally and followed by simple statements. Check situations where the
raise operation gets triggered or not, enforcing variations on the
conditionals guards. Verify that the explicit raise statements are
properly processed as regular statements and that the control flow
transfers are reflected on the coverage status of the statements
following the raise and in the exception handlers.

Also exercise a few cases involving implicit raise events, for example
out of a range check. Verify that the control flow effects induced by
such events is also properly represented, on the triggering statements
and those that immediately follow.
