SC on statements evaluating "A or else B" where operands might raise
====================================================================

This group gathers Statement Coverage testcases for statements evaluating 
an expression of the form "A or else B" in various contexts (controlling 
an IF, right hand side of an assignment, ...) and where each operand might 
raise an exception in different circumstances (language check, subprogram 
call, ..).
