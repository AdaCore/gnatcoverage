SC on statements evaluating "A and then B" where operands might raise
=====================================================================

This group gathers Statement Coverage testcases for statements evaluating
an expression of the form "A and then B" in various contexts (controlling
an IF, right hand side of an assignment, ...) and where each operand might
raise an exception in different circumstances (language check, subprogram
call, ..).
