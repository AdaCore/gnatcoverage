multiple kinds of raise operations, implicit or explicit
=========================================================

Check SC for multiple kinds of raise operations, implicit or explicit,
for language- or user-defined exceptions in various program contexts.

Because of the ZFP limitation on exception propagation,
the only case to check is within a given subprogram.
