A CASE statement contains more than one execution path (referred as CASE
alternatives or simply alternatives below), and the execution of a CASE
statement executes exactly one alternative. Each CASE alternative contains
other statements as its components.

If a CASE statement is not executed, the statement itself and all the
statements in all its alternatives shall be reported as uncovered (Test case
No_Execution).

If a CASE statement is executed once, the statement itself and the component
statements of the alternative that is executed shall be reported as covered
and for all the other alternatives all their component statements shall be
reported as uncovered (Test case One_Alternative)

If a CASE statement is executed more than once, then the statement itself and
component statements of all the alternatives that are chosen for the
executions of this statement shall be reported as covered, and the component
statements of the alternatives that are not executed shall be reported as
uncovered (Test case Several_Alternatives).

**Testing strategy**

Different syntax forms of CASE statement should be checked:

* with and without OTHERS choice;
* choices defined by an expression and by a range;
* choices containing one value and multiple values.
