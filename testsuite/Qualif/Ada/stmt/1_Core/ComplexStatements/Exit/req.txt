An exit statement is a simple statement. If an exit statement is not executed
then it shall be reported as uncovered.

An exit statement can be used only as a component of some loop statement. If
the enclosing loop statement is not executed and if it does not go at least in
its first iteration, all the enclosed exit statements shall be reported as
uncovered.

**Testing strategy**

Both syntax forms of exit statement (with and without condition) shall be
checked.

The case of nested loop statements and EXIT statement in inner loop that
transfers the control out of outer loop shall be checked.

The case when a loop contains more than one exit statement shall be checked.

This requirement and the corresponding tests are about coverage of an exit
statement itself, but not about coverage of the components of a loop statement
that contains an exit statement. See Loop_Statements for loop statement
coverage.
