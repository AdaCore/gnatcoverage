Check that if an IF statement is executed, and its IF path is chosen, then
this path and all its component statements are reported as covered. All the
other paths (if any) and components thereof are reported as uncovered. The
test driver executes the functional code in such a way that IF path are
chosen for all the IF statements contained in the code.
