A statement shall be reported as uncovered if it is not executed.

Some statements are called simple statements, a simple statement is considered
as an atomic construct for the coverage analysis purposes.

Some other statements are compound statements. A compound statement contains
another (simple or compound) statements as components thereof. If a compound
statement is not executed, the statement itself and all its component
statements shall be reported as uncovered. If a compound statement is executed
but a control transfer takes place as a part of its execution, and this
control transfer goes outside the statement, then the component statements
that have not been executed before this control transfer shall be reported as
uncovered.

Some compound statements contain execution paths. An execution path is a part
of the statement corresponding to a separate edge in the program control
graph. If a statement path is not chosen when executing the statement, all the
component statements belonging to this part shall be reported as uncovered. A
statement path may contain a condition that defines if this path shall be
chosen as a part of the statement execution. If this expression is not
evaluated as a part of the statement execution, the corresponding part of the
path shall be reported as noncovered.

**Testing strategy**

This tool operation requirement is split into subordinate requirements
according to the sections of Chapter 5 (Statements) of ARM:

* Null_Statements       (5.1 Simple and Compound Statements, Sequences of such)
* Assignment_Statements (5.2 Assignment Statements)
* If_Statements         (5.3 If Statements)
* Case_Statements       (5.4 Case Statements)
* Loop_Statements       (5.5 Loop Statements)
* Block_Statements      (5.6 Block Statements)
* Exit_Statements       (5.7 Exit Statements)
