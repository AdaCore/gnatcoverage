Statement coverage shall be assessed correctly for a GOTO statement that is a
part of the statement sequence in a CASE statement path:

* a GOTO statement shall not be reported as covered if the enclosing path of
  the CASE statement is not entered;

* if execution of a GOTO statement transfers the control out of the CASE
  statement path, the statements that follow this GOTO statement in the CASE
  statement path shall be reported as not covered

**Testing Strategy**

Test cases shall include CASE statement path with explicit list of choices and
with OTHERS choice. The case with more then one GOTO statement inside a path
should be checked, test case shall cause execution of different GOTO
statements inside the path.

Tests do not have to concentrate on GOTO statements outside CASE statements.
