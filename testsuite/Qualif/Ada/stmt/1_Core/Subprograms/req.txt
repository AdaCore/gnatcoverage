Statement coverage shall be assessed correctly for Ada subprogram constructs
according to the semantics of these constructs as described in Chapter 6
"Subprograms" of the Ada Reference Manual.

**Testing strategy**
Check the following aspects:

* Coverage of subprogram declaration does not imply coverasge of subprogram body.
* Coverage of inherited subprograms, including overriding ones.
* Coverage of inlined subprograms
* Coverage of the return statement
