Check that an object declaration is reported as uncovered if it is not
elaborated, and that it is not reported as uncovered if it is elaborated.

Check the following kinds of object declarations for which we expect to have
implicit execution of code for the initializations:

* object declarations with explicit initialization expressions;

* declarations of objects whose types define implicit initialization (this
  includes record types and access types).

Check local and global declarations, declarations located in functions and in
subprograms.
