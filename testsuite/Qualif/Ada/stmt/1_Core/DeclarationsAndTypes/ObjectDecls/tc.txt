Check SC assessments over Object Declarations.

Check that an object declaration is reported as uncovered iif it is not
elaborated.

Check the following kinds of object declarations for which we expect to have
implicit execution of code for the initializations:

* object declarations with explicit initialization expressions;

* declarations of objects whose types define implicit initialization (this
  includes record types and access types).

Check local and global declarations, declarations located in functions and in
subprograms.
