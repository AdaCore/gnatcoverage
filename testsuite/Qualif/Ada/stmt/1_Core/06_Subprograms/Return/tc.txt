Return statements

Check that:

* A RETURN statement reported as uncovered when it is not executed.

* If a RETURN statement is executed then all the statements in a subprogram
  body that have not been executed by that moment shall be reported as
  uncovered.

Check RETURN statements in procedure and in function. Check the
situation when the body contains more then one RETURN statement.
