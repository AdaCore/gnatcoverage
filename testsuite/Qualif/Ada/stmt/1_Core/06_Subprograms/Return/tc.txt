Check that RETURN statements are handled correctly

A RETURN statement is both a statement per se and a flow-control
operator. Check that:

* A RETURN statement reported as uncovered when it is not executed.

* When a RETURN statement is executed, all the statements in the subprogram
  body that have not been executed by that moment are reported as uncovered.

Check RETURN statements in procedure and in function. Check the situation when
the body contains more than one RETURN statement.
