Check that subprogram overrides are handled correctly

Check that overriding subprograms are recognized as distinct from
the one they redefine, in particular that

* The code of a subprogram is reported as uncovered if neither
  this subprogram nor any subprogram inherited from it (directly or
  indirectly) is called.

* A call to an overriding subprogram does not result in reporting the code of
  the overridden subprogram as covered.

Check multiple levels of inheritance and different kinds of subprogram
invocation:

* Ordinary calls by means of a call statement/function call expression;

* Dynamic calls through OO dispatching or access-to-subprogram value;

* Implicit calls as the result of evaluation of default initialization
  expressions;
