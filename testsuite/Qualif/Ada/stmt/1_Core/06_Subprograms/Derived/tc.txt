Derived subprograms

Check that:

* The code of a user-defined subprogram is reported as uncovered if neither
  this subprogram nor any subprogram inherited from it (directly or
  indirectly) is called.

* A call to overriding subprogram does not result in reporting the code of
  overridden subprogram as covered.

The functional code includes more then one level of inheritance. Test drivers
call inherited subprograms in different ways, including dispatching calls,
calls through access-to-subprogram value and calls resulted from evaluating of
default expressions.

Check different kinds of subprogram invocation:

* ordinary calls by means of a call statement/function call expression;
* dynamic calls through access-to-subprogram value;
* implicit calls as the result of evaluation of default initialization
  expressions;
