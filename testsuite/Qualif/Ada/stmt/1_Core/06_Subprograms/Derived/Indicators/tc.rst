**Exercise SC in presence of overriding indicators**

Check that SC assessments aren't influenced by the presence of
overriding indicators. Verify the correctness of a few SC assessments
over primitive subprograms of a derived type, 2 overriding a primitive
of the parent type, one marked with an "overriding" indicator and
the other not, and 2 new primitives, one marked with a "not overriding"
indicator and the other not.
