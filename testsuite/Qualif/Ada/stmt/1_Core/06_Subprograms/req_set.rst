SC expectations regarding ARM chap. 6 : Subprograms

This is split as a set of requirements:

%(subset-index)s

While each requirement features a distinct testing strategy, a common scheme

* Some but not all of the code executes,

* All the code executes,

* None of the code executes (subprogram is not called).
