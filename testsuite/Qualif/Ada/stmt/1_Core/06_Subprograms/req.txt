SC expectations regarding ARM chap. 6 : Subprograms

%(req-headline)s

Statement coverage shall be assessed correctly for Ada subprogram constructs
described in Chapter 6 "Subprograms" of the Ada Reference Manual. This is
split as a set of subsidiary requirements:

%(subset-index)s

%(tstrategy-headline)s

The subsidiary requirements all have a distinct testing strategy. Here is
a direct index of the corresponding testcases:

%(tc-index)s

A common scheme governs the organization of all the testcases: they all
exercise subprograms arranging to have a mix of cases where:

* Some but not all of the code executes,

* All the code executes,

* None of the code executes (the subprogram is not called).
