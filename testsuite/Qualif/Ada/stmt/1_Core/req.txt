Material to define and validate the core expectations for Statement Coverage
(SC) assessments. All the other SC related sections rely on this one.

%(req-headline)s

A language construct shall be reported as uncovered if it is not executed or
elaborated as a part of a program execution.

%(tstrategy-headline)s

The further decomposition of this general requirement is based on the
structure of the Ada Reference Manual (ARM). We consider the following
chapters of the ARM:

%(subset-index)s

Other ARM chapters are not considered as the base for subordinate requirements
because of the following reasons:

==============================  ===============================================
Chapter                         Not included because ...
==============================  ===============================================
1 (General)                     No language construct described

4 (Names and Expressions)       The described constructs are not considered on
                                their own for coverage analysis purposes. The
			        coverage information is computed for enclosing
                                statement or declaration constructs

9 (Tasks and Synchronization)   The execution profile being qualified is based
                                on Zero Foot Print run-time, which does not
                                support any construct described in this chapter

13 (Representation Issues)      Constructs described in this chapter do not
                                result in executable code so they are of no
                                interest for coverage analysis.
