Define and validate the core expectations for Statement Coverage
(SC) assessments. All the other SC related sections rely on this one.

%(req-headline)s

A language statement or declaration construct shall be reported as uncovered
if it is not executed or elaborated as a part of the program execution.

%(tstrategy-headline)s

To ensure coverage of all the relevant language constructs, we decompose the
validation of this general requirement in accordance with the Ada Reference
Manual (ARM), as follows:

%(subset-index)s

A few chapters are not included, for the following reasons:

==============================  ===============================================
Chapter                         Not included because ...
==============================  ===============================================
1 (General)                     No language construct described

4 (Names and Expressions)       The described constructs are not considered on
                                their own for coverage analysis purposes. The
			        coverage information is computed for enclosing
                                statement or declaration constructs

9 (Tasks and Synchronization)   The execution profile being qualified is based
                                on Zero Foot Print run-time, which does not
                                support any construct described in this chapter

13 (Representation Issues)      Constructs described in this chapter do not
                                result in executable code so they are of no
                                interest for coverage analysis.
