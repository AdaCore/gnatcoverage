A block statement contains others statements and (optionally) declarations and
exception handlers as its components. If the execution does not reach a block
statement, all its components shall be reported as uncovered.

**Testing strategy**

* Check varios syntax forms of a block statement (with and without a
declarative part, with and without exception handlers) in different contexts;

* Check nested block statements.
