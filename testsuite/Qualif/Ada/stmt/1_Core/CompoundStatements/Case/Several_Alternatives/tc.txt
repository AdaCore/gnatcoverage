Check that if a CASE statement is executed  several times, then:
* the statement itself is covered;
* all chosen alternatives are covered;
* at least the first statement of the chosen alternatives are covered;
* all non-chosen alternatives, and the statements they contain, are non-covered.

Check different forms of the CASE statement.
