The coverage of the statements inside the LOOP statement shall depend 
on the evaluation of the loop condition. If the LOOP condition is not evaluated,
the all preceding statements shall not be covered. If the
LOOP condition is evaluated to FALSE during the first iteration,
then all subsequent statements shall not be covered.
If the LOOP condition is evaluated to TRUE at least once,
then at least the first subsequent statement shall be covered.

**Testing strategy**

Check the coverage when:
* the LOOP condition is evaluated to TRUE;
* the LOOP condition is evaluated to FALSE;
* the LOOP condition is not evaluated

Check different syntax forms of LOOP statement:
* FOR loop;
* reverse FOR loop;
* WHILE loop;
* unconditional loop.
