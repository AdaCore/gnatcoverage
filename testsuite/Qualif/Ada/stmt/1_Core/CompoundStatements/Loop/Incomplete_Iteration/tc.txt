Check LOOP with an EXIT condition evaluated False the first time around.

Check that, if the EXIT condition is evaluated to FALSE during the first
iteration then:

* all statements preceding it are covered;

* all statements within the LOOP statement and following the LOOP condition
  are not covered.

Check (inverted) FOR, WHILE and unconditional loops.
