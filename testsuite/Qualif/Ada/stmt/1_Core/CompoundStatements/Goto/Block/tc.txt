Statement coverage shall be assessed correctly for a GOTO statement that is a
part of the statement sequence in a block statement:

* if the block statement is not entered, the GOTO statement shall not be
  reported as covered;

* if the GOTO statement transfers the control out of the block statement, the
  statements in the block statement sequence that follow this GOTO statement
  shall not be reported as covered;

* ??? what about exception handlers? We have all the code compiled with
  -gnatp.

**Testing strategy**

Tests do not have to concentrate on GOTO statements outside CASE statements.
