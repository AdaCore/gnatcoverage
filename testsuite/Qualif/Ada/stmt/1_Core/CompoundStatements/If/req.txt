An IF statement is composed by an IF branch, zero or more ELSIF branches and zero or one
ELSE branch. Each branch contains one or more statements. 

The coverage of an IF statement shall depend on the evaluation of its branches. If a branch is
evaluated, then it shall be reported as covered. If a branch is chosen, then at least the first statement
it contains shall be covered.

**Testing strategy**

Check different forms of IF statements, with/without ELSIF branches and with/without ELSE branches.
Check the coverage when:
* the IF branch is not evaluated
* the IF branch is chosen
* one ELSIF branch is chosen
* the ELSE branch is chosen
* multiple branches are chosen via multiple invocations.
