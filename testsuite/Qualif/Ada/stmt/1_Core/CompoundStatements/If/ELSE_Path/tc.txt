Check that if an IF statement is executed and the ElSE branch is chosen then:
* the IF brach is covered;
* all ELSIF branches are reported as covered;
* all statements contained in the IF and ELSIF branches are reported as uncovered.
* at least the first statement in the ELSE branch are reported as coverted.
Check the coverage of IF statements with and without the ELSE branch.
