Check that if an IF statement is executed and one ElSIF branch is chosen, then:
* the IF branch is covered, but the statements it contains are uncovered;
* all ELSIF branches before the chosen one are reported as covered, but the
statements they contain are reported as uncovered;
* the chosen ELSIF branch is covered;
* at least the first statement contained in the chosen ELSIF branch is covered;
* the ELSE branch and the statements it contains are uncovered. 
Check IF statements with one and more ELSIF branches.
