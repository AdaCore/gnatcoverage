If Statements (ARM 5.3)

%(req-headline)s

An IF statement comprises an IF branch, zero or more ELSIF branches and zero
or one ELSE branch. IF and ELSIF branches feature a control expression and all
the branches contain one or more statements. The nested statements get to
execute when the flow reaches the branch and the control expression, if any,
evaluates True.

IF and ELSIF branches that are never reached shall be reported uncovered, and
all the SC requirements apply to all the nested statements, recursively.
