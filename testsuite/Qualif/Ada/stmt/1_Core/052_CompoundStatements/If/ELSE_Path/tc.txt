Check IF/ELSE statements with only the ELSE part chosen.

Check that if an IF statement is executed and the ELSE branch is chosen then:

* the IF branch is covered;

* all ELSIF branches are reported as covered;

* all statements contained in the IF and ELSIF branches are reported as
  uncovered.

* at least the first statement in the ELSE branch are reported as coverted.

Check the coverage of IF statements with and without the ELSE branch.
