SC expectations regarding Loop statements (ARM 5.5)

%(req-headline)s

LOOP statements feature a mandatory loop *header* that introduces the
control-flow iteration scheme, and an optional set of exit statements.

* With and without exit statements for all variants, located at various places
  in the nested sequence (at the beginning, at the end, somewhere in between),

* Within a variety of source contexts (regular function, procedure or package
  elaboration bodies, generic instances)

All through a panel of iteration schemes:
