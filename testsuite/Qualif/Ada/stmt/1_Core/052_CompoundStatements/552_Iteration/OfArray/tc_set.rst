Exercise SC over For Of iterations on arrays
============================================

Check SC assessments on subprograms featuring "for ... of" loops over array
objects of various sorts (statically sized arrays of integers or object
references, possibly packed, with unconstrained types, global or received
as a parameter, ...).

Verify a range of cases where the for loop may be not reached at all, reached
and executed partially or completely, with surrounding statements before and
after the loop.
