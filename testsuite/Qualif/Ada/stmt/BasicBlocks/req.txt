Statement coverage is assessed correctly for straightline sequences (basic
blocks) and combinations of such constructed with jump-like control flow
transfers (goto, return, raise, exit).

If execution reaches the top of a basic block, no statement in the block is
reported uncovered. Conversely, if execution doesn't reach the top of a basic
block, all the statements in the block are reported uncovered.
