Generic testcase which exercises a function returning the Min of an Integer
argument X and 2, resorting to arbitrary control-flow transfers to do so.

The testcase relies on the exposure of a consistent set of line designators by
the different implementations:

 /xle2/ for lines reached only when X <= 2
 /xgt2/ for lines reached only when X > 2
 /common/ for lines reached in both cases, as soon as the function is called

Each test scenario calls the function for a well defined set of situations
and verifies that results match the corresponding expectations.
