Exercise code which features a simple If statement nested in one of the
possible selections of a Case statement, itself conditioned by an outer If
statement executed as part of a While loop.

Check situations where:

* The loop is not entered

* The loop is entered and the first If statement control evaluates only False,
  hence the inner Case statement is never reached

* The inner Case statement is reached for each possible selection alone, then
  for combinations of them. The inner If statement is exercised both ways.
