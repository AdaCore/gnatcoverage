**Exercise a simple IF statement within a WHILE/IF/CASE statement nesting**

Exercise a simple IF statement nested in one of the alternatives of a
CASE statement, which in turn is in a branch of an outer IF statement
that is within a WHILE loop body.

Check situations where:

* The loop is not entered

* The loop is entered and the first If statement control evaluates only False,
  and thus the inner Case statement is never reached

* The inner Case statement is reached for each possible selection alone, then
  for combinations of them. The inner If statement is exercised both ways.
