Exercise a simple If statement, within a While loop/If statement/Case statement nesting
========================================================================================

Exercise a simple If statement nested in one of the alternatives of a
Case statement, which in turn is in a branch of an outer If statement
that is within a While loop.

Check situations where:

* The loop is not entered

* The loop is entered and the first If statement control evaluates only False,
  and thus the inner Case statement is never reached

* The inner Case statement is reached for each possible selection alone, then
  for combinations of them. The inner If statement is exercised both ways.
