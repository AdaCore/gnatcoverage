Exercise a toplevel If statement, whose Else sequence contains a For Loop, whose body contains an IF statement controlling access to a Case statement
======================================================================================================================================================

Exercise a compound statement with deep nesting:
a top-level If statement whose else clause contains
a For loop, which in turn encloses an inner If statement that controls access
to a Case statement.

Check various control paths through the outer If statement, the For loop
entry, the inner If statement, and the possible Case alternatives;
first independently from each other and then combined.
