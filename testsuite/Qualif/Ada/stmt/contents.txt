Several sets of requirements/testcases:

IsolatedConstructs:
-------------------

Elaborated out of a systematic pass over the Ada Reference Manual, to make
sure the suite is representative of all the language aspects we need to
handle.

BasicBlocks:
------------

Standlone section elaborated out of SVTAS proposals to demonstrate proper
processing of statement sequences and various possible forms of control-flow
transfers, fundamental mecanism for an imperative language.

In addition to offer a useful set focused on control flow, tests in this
section were written by a different team, which augments the robustness of the
suite as a whole.

Sanity:
-------

Elaborated out of SVTAS proposals to demonstrate that the toolset correctly
handles potentially confusing constructs that would fool naive analyzers for
various sorts of reasons.

Also includes testcases to define and verify our toolset behavior in special
cases such as multiple statements sharing a line or a single statement
spanning multiple lines.
