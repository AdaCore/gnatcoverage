Exercise code which features a simple If statement nested in one of the
possible selections of a Case statement, itself conditioned by an outer If
statement executed as part of a While loop.

We implement a double testing strategy, with:

# Statement coverage oriented scenarii, exercising SC possibilities (loop
  entered or not, If part of an If statement reached or not, Case statement
  selections reached or not, ...)  and combinations of such.

# Decision coverage oriented scenarii, exercising DC possibilities (such or
  such decision True only, False only, or both True and False) and
  combinations of such.
