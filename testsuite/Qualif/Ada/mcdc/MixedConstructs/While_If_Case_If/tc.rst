Exercise a simple If statement nested in one of the possible selections of a
Case statement, itself conditioned by an outer If statement executed as part of
a While loop.

We implement a double testing strategy, with:

* Statement coverage oriented scenarii, exercising combinations of SC
  possibilities on each kind of statement (loop entered or not, If part of an
  If statement reached or not, Case statement selections reached or not, ...),

* Decision coverage oriented scenarii, exercising combinations of
  DC possibilities on each decision.
