**Exercise a simple IF statement nested in a CASE alternative, conditioned by an outer IF executed as part of a WHILE loop**

We implement a double testing strategy, with:

* Statement coverage-oriented scenarios, exercising SC possibilities (loop
  entered or not, IF part of an IF statement reached or not, CASE statement
  alternatives reached or not, ...) and combinations of these.

* Decision coverage-oriented scenarios, exercising DC possibilities
  (a given decision True only, False only, or both True and False) and
  combinations of these.
