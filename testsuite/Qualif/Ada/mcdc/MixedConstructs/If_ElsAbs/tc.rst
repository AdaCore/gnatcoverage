**Exercise MCDC over an IF/ELSIF construct with complex decisions**

Check combinations of possibilities on the IF controlling decision (decision
True, False, or both with various degrees of condition independence). Likewise
on the ELSIF controlling decision, which only gets evaluated when the IF
decision yields False.
