MCDC expectations with respect to potentially confusing constructs,
===================================================================

MCDC expectations with respect to potentially confusing constructs,
e.g. multiple decisions sharing a line.


Requirement(s)
--------------



The Core MCDC requirements shall remain satisfied in presence of constructs
that could fool simple minded analyzers.


Testing Strategy
----------------



Check a panel of cases where code construct particularities could concievably
cause inaccuracies or errors in coverage diagnostics if the tool were to
implement too simple analysis schemes:


.. qmlink:: TCIndexImporter
