MCDC expectations for exemption regions
=======================================

.. rubric:: Requirement(s)

Exemption regions shall operate over MCDC violations as they do for statement
coverage violations.


.. rubric:: Testing Strategy

Check proper behavior on decisions placed in a restricted set of possible
contexts, to validate that the exemption facility works for mcdc violations
specifically. Proper behavior over context variations is deemed validated by
the statement coverage testcases.
