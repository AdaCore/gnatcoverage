****Exercise consolidation over ``Andthen (X => A and then B, Y => C or else D)``,****
Exercise consolidation over ``Andthen (X => A and then B, Y => C or else D)``,
with an ``X and then Y`` evaluation within the Andthen function.

Arrange to have four distinct executions corresponding to the possible
values of each primary decision (True/False for A and then B together
with True/False for C or else D), and verify that consolidating any two
of these executions together yields the expected results for each decision.
