**Exercise MCDC consolidation over "Andthen (X => A and then B, Y => C or else D)"**

Arrange to have four distinct executions corresponding to the possible
values of each primary decision (True/False for A and then B together
with True/False for C or else D), and verify that consolidating any two
of these executions together yields the expected results for each decision.
