Material to define and validate the expected processing of multiple execution
traces combined together.

%(req)s

When the coverage achieved by multiple execution traces is evaluated, an mcdc
violation shall only be reported when it would have been for all the traces
individually.

%(tstrat)s

We exercise consolidation of traces obtained for single vector invocations
over a range of basic decisions.

For decisions with two operands, we check all the possible combinations of
inputs without repetitions.

We operate similarily for decisions with three operands, except we aggregate
inputs that differ only on non-evaluated conditions.
