This section groups testcase aimed at checking that the tool is able to handle
decisions of arbitrary topology, in any context where they are allowed.

We exercise a range of boolean expression topologies over boolean variables,
each in a representative set of common program contexts where such expressions
might appear. MCDC is equivalent to DC for decisions with only one condition,
so we have no testcase for such decisions here.
