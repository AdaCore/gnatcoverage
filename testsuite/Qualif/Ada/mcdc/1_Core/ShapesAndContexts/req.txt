MCDC assessments shall be able to handle arbitrarily complex
decisions, in any context where they are allowed by the source language.

**Testing Strategy**

We exercise

* A range of boolean expressions over boolean variables, each in a
  representative set of common program contexts where such expressions might
  appear [And AndCOr AndIdOr AndpOrp Coupled Diamonds Or pAndpOr pOrpAndpOrp].

  MCDC is equivalent to DC for decisions with only one condition, so we have
  no testcase for such decisions here.
