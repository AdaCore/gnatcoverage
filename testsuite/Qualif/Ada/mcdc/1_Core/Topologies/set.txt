Check the tool's capability to
perform correct MCDC assessments on expressions of arbitrary topology
everywhere they might appear.

We exercise a panel of expression topologies over Boolean variables (single
value, negated, two or more combined with and-then or or-else, ...), each
placed in a variety of program contexts.  MCDC is equivalent to DC for
decisions with only one condition so we have no testcase for such decisions
here.
