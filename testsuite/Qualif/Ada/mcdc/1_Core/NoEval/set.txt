This section groups testcases that check proper differentiation of a case
involving a decision enclosed in an uncovered statement versus that of a
decision possibly unevaluated despite coverage of the enclosing statement.

We verify that "decision never evaluated" diagnostics are emitted in the
latter case versus statement coverage violations in the former case.
