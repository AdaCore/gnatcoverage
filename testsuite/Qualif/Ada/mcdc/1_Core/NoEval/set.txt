This section groups testcases that check proper differentiation of a case
involving a decision enclosed in an uncovered statement versus that of a
decision never evaluated despite coverage of the enclosing statement. They
verify that "decision never evaluated" diagnostics are emitted in the latter
case versus statement coverage violations in the former case.
