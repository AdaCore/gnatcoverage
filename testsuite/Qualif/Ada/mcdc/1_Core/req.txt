1. For decisions evaluated both True and False, the tool shall report every
   condition for which the independent effect was not demonstrated. Such
   condition specific diagnotics shall designate the particular condition
   source location.

2. The tool shall be able to handle arbitrarily complex decisions in any
   context where such expressions might appear, as long as all the logical
   connectors operate with short-circuit semantics.

**Testing Strategy**

We check that all the aspects of this requirement are satisfied in a variety
of situations:

* With expressions involving different kinds of operands, not only
  straight Boolean variables [Operands].

* With expressions of different shapes placed in various contexts, to
  verify the tool's capability to handle arbitrary expressions everywhere
  they might appear [ShapesAndContexts];

We exercise each decision of interest in multiple manners, always including

* a set of vectors where the decision evaluates only True,

* a set of vectors where the decision evaluates only False,

* a set of vectors where the decision evaluates both True and False, some
  demonstrating the independant effect of all the conditions and some not,

* a situation where the statements exposing the decision aren't
  executed at all.
