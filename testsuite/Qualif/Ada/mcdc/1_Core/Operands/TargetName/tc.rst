**MC/DC on simple decisions involving the Target Name symbol**

We can only have a single value for the target name symbol in a given
expression, so it is not possible to create a complex boolean expression
with only target name symbols as conditions. This test nonetheless checks
that coverage is correctly reported on them when they appear as a decisions
condition.
