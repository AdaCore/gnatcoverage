This section groups testcases aimed at checking that the is able to handle
conditions of arbitrary complexity in decisions.

We exercise simple decisions involving various possible kinds of conditions,
either isolated or mixed with other kinds. We make sure here to exercise cases
where conditions require internal comparisons not directly representative of
the condition False/True value determination itself, for example implicit
tests for null ranges to evaluate the length value in an expression like
"S'length > 12".
