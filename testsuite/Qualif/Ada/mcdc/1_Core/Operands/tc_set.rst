Decisions with various kinds of conditions, not just Boolean variables
======================================================================

Check the correctness of MCDC assessments on decisions featuring all the possible forms
of conditions, not only Boolean variables.

We exercise basic decisions involving various possible kinds of conditions
(attribute references, subprogram calls, ...), either isolated or mixed with
other kinds in a variety of program contexts. We make sure here to exercise
cases known to require internal comparisons, to demonstrate that the tool
knows to distinguish internal tests from those representative of each
condition valuation.
