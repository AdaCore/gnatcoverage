MCDC coverage assessment shall recognize all the possible forms of
conditions in a decision, not only boolean variables.

**Testing Strategy**

We exercise simple decisions involving various possible kinds of conditions,
either isolated or mixed with other kinds.

We make sure here to exercise cases where conditions require internal
comparisons not directly representative of the condition False/True value
determination itself, for example tests for null ranges to evaluate the
length value in an expression like "S'length > 12".
