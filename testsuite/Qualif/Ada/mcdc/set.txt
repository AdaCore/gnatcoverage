This section holds the tool operational requirements and associated testcases
related to Modified Condition/Decision Coverage assessments.  This is split in
several parts:

**Core**

Holds material to define and validate the core expectations for MC/DC
assessments.

**Sanity**

Holds material to demonstrate that the toolset correctly handles potentially
confusing constructs that would fool naive analyzers.

**Consolidation**

Holds material to define and validate the expected processing of multiple
execution traces combined together.

**Exemptions**

Holds material to define and validate the expected processing of exemption
regions.
