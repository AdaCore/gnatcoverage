This section holds the Tool Operational Requirements and associated testcases
related to Modified Condition/Decision Coverage assessments.  This is split in
several parts:

*Core*             define and validate the core expectations
                   for MC/DC assessments.  All the other sub-sections rely on
                   this one.

*Robustness*       demonstrate that the toolset correctly
                   handles potentially confusing constructs that would fool
                   naive analyzers.
                   This includes cases such as multiple decisions sharing a
                   line or a single decision spanning multiple lines.

*MixedConstructs*  demonstrate that the toolset correctly handles mixes of
                   various statement and decision constructs, representative
                   of what would be found in real applications.

*Consolidation*    define and validate the expected
                   processing of multiple execution traces combined together.

*Exemptions*       define and validate the expected
                   processing of exemption regions.
