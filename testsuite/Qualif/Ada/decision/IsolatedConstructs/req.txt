When a decision is never evaluated, it's enclosing statement or declaration
shall be reported uncovered.

When a decision is evaluated only True or only False, it shall be reported
as only partially covered.

When a decision is evaluated both True and False, no decision coverage
violation shall be reported for it.

The tool shall be able to handle arbitrarily complex decisions in any context
where such expressions might appear, as long as all the logical connectors
operate with short-circuit semantics.

**Testing Strategy**

Check that all the aspects of this requirement are satisfied
in a variety of situations:

* With expressions of different shapes placed in various contexts, to
  verify the tool's capability to handle arbitrary expressions everywhere
  they might appear.

* With expression operands known to require internal computations with tests,
  to make sure the tool knows to distinguish internal tests from those
  expressed at the user source level.

In all those cases, we exercise each decision with several sets of condition
vectors, always including some where [TO BE COMPLETED]
