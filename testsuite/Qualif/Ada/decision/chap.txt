This section holds the tool operational requirements and associated testcases
to validate the tool behavior with respect to Decision Coverage capabilities.
This is split in several parts:

**LoneConstructs**

Holds requirements and testcases to define and validate the expected
processing of decisions within isolated Ada language constructs.

**Sanity**

Holds requirements and testcases to demonstrate that the toolset correctly
handles potentially confusing constructs that would fool naive analyzers.

This includes cases such as multiple decisions sharing a line or a single
decision spanning multiple lines.

**Consolidation**

Holds requirements and testscases to define and validate the expected
processing of multiple execution traces combined together.

**Exemptions**

Holds requirements and testscases to define and validate the expected
processing of exemption regions.
