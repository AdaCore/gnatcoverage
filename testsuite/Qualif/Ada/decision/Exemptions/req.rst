DC expectations for exemption regions
=====================================

DC expectations regarding exemption regions.


.. rubric:: Requirement(s)



Exemption regions shall apply to decision coverage violations as they do
to statement coverage violations.


.. rubric:: Testing Strategy



Check proper behavior for decisions placed in several possible
contexts, to validate that the exemption facility works for decision coverage
violations specifically. Proper behavior over contexts in general is deemed
validated by the statement coverage testcases.
