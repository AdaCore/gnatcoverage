Exercise the use of an exemption region to exempt a functional precondition
expressed in a subprogram declarative part.

Check outcome expectations for

* situations where the precondition is always evaluated True
  (nominal case, exempted violations at level A)

* situations where the precondition is evaluated only False
  (force error case, exempted violations at level A)

* consolidation of the previous cases: precondition exercized both
  ways (no exempted violation)
