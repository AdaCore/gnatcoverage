Exercise the use of an exemption region to exempt a functional precondition
expressed in a subprogram declarative part. Check:

* Situations where the precondition is always evaluated True
  (nominal case, exempted DC violation)

* Situations where the precondition is evaluated only False
  (force error case, exempted DC violation)

* Consolidation of the previous cases: precondition exercized both
  ways (no exempted violation)
