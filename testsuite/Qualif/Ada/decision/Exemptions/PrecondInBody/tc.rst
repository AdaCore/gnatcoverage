**Exercise exemptions over an explicit assertion early in a subprogram body**

Check:

* Situations where the test always evaluates to True
  (nominal case, exempted DC violation)

* Situations where the test only evaluates to False
  (force error case, exempted DC violation)

* Consolidation of the previous cases: test exercised both
  ways (no exempted violation)
