This section holds the tool operational requirements and associated testcases
related to Decision Coverage (DC) assessments.  This is split in several parts:

**Core**

Holds material to define and validate the core expectations for DC
assessments.  All the other sub-sections rely on this one.

**Sanity**

Holds material to demonstrate that the toolset correctly handles potentially
confusing constructs that would fool naive analyzers.

This includes cases such as multiple decisions sharing a line or a single
decision spanning multiple lines.

**Consolidation**

Holds material to define and validate the expected processing of multiple
execution traces combined together.

**Exemptions**

Holds material to define and validate the expected processing of exemption
regions.
