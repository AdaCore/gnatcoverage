This section groups testcases aimed at verifying the tool's capability to
perform correct DC assessments on expressions of arbitrary topology everywhere
they might appear.

We exercise a panel of expression topologies over Boolean variables (single
value, negated, two or more combined with and-then or or-else, ...), each
placed in a variety of program contexts. We distinguish explicit control-flow
constructs from other contexts.
