Check the correctness of DC assessments on expressions of various topologies everywhere they
============================================================================================

Check the correctness of DC assessments on expressions of various topologies everywhere they
might appear.

We exercise a panel of expression topologies over Boolean variables (single
value, negated, two or more combined with and-then or or-else, ...), each
placed in a variety of program contexts. We distinguish explicit control-flow
constructs from other contexts.
