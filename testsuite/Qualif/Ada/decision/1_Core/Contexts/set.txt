This section groups testcases aimed at verifying the tool's capability to
handle arbitrary expressions everywhere they might appear.

Expressions of various topologies are exercised in various contexts where they
might appear, separating

* Control-flow constructs where the expressions indeed act as decisions, from

* Other contexts, where the expressions shall only be recognized as decisions
  for a DO178 level A qualification.
