This section groups testcases aimed at verifying the tool's capability to
handle expressions of arbitrary topology everywhere they might appear.  We
distinguish two classes of possible contexts:

* Control-flow constructs where the expressions indeed act as decisions, from

* Other contexts, where the expressions shall only be recognized as decisions
  for a DO178 level A qualification.
