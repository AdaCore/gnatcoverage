Decision coverage assessments shall be able to handle arbitrarily complex

**Testing Strategy**

We exercise

* A range of boolean expressions over boolean variables, each in a
  representative set of common program contexts where such expressions might
  appear, and involving one condition [Flip, Value] or more [And, Or]

* Basic expressions in particular contexts [NoEval, Preconditions]
