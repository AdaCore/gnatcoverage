This section groups testcases aimed at verifying that the tool handles all the
possible forms of conditions in a decision, not only boolean variables.

We exercise simple decisions involving various possible kinds of conditions,
either isolated or mixed with other kinds. We make sure here to exercise cases
known to require internal comparisons, to demonstrate that the tool knows to
distinguish internal tests aimed at computing a condition value versus tests
aimed at computing the decision from the condition values.
