This section groups testcases aimed at cheking the tool's capability to
perform correct DC assessments on decisions featuring all the possible forms
of conditions, not only Boolean variables.

We exercise simple decisions involving various possible kinds of conditions,
either isolated or mixed with other kinds. We make sure here to exercise cases
known to require internal comparisons, to demonstrate that the tool knows to
distinguish internal tests aimed at computing a condition value versus tests
aimed at computing the decision from the condition values.
