Decisions featuring various forms of conditions, not just Boolean variables
===========================================================================

Check the correctness of DC assessments on decisions with various kinds
of conditions, not only Boolean variables.

Exercise basic decisions involving different kinds of conditions
(such as attribute references and subprogram calls), either in isolation
or combined with other conditions, in a variety of program contexts.

We include cases known to require internal comparisons, to
demonstrate that the tool can distinguish between internal tests that
compute a condition value, from tests that compute the decision from
the condition values.
