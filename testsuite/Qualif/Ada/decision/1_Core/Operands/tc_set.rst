DC on decisions with various kinds of conditions, not only mere Boolean variables
=================================================================================

Exercise basic decisions involving different kinds of conditions
(such as attribute references and subprogram calls), either in isolation
or combined with other conditions, in a variety of program contexts.

We include cases known to require internal comparisons, to
demonstrate that the tool can distinguish between internal tests that
compute a condition value, from tests that compute the decision from
the condition values.
