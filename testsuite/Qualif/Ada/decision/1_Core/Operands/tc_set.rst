Decisions featuring various forms of conditions, not just Boolean variables
============================================================================

Check the correctness of DC assessments on decisions featuring various possible forms
of conditions, not only Boolean variables.

Exercise basic decisions involving various possible kinds of conditions
(attribute references, subprogram calls, ...), either isolated or mixed with
other kinds in a variety of program contexts.

We make sure here to exercise cases known to require internal comparisons, to
demonstrate that the tool knows to distinguish internal tests aimed at
computing a condition value versus tests aimed at computing the decision from
the condition values.
