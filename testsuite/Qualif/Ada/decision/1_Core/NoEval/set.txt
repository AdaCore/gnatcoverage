This section groups testcases aimed at checking the tool's capability to
handle situations where decisions are not evaluated (don't yield an outcome)
even though the statement they control is executed. This typically happens
when an evaluation is interrupted by an exception occurrence.

We exercise a range of expressions where each condition could be made to raise
an exception in a panel of cases, checking that

* a "decision never evaluated" diagnostic is emitted when no evaluation
  succeeds at all, and that

* exception occurrences don't influence the coverage achieved by otherwise
  successful evaluations.
