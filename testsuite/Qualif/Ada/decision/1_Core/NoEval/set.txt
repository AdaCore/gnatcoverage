This section groups testcases aimed at checking the tool's capability
to handle situations where decisions are not evaluated even though the
statement they control is executed.

The general idea is to exercise expressions where each condition could be made
to raise an exception, stopping the decision evaluation. We check that

* a "decision never evaluated" diagnostic is emitted when no evaluation
  succeeds at all, and that

* exception occurrences don't influence the coverage achieved by otherwise
  successful evaluations.

... for a variety of cases; different expression topologies and different
sources of exceptions.
