When a decision is enclosed in a statement or declaration that has not been
executed, that statement or declaration shall be reported as not covered and
nothing shall be reported about the decision.

When a decision is never evaluated even though the enclosing statement or
declaration has been executed, the decision shall be reported as enever
evaluated.

When a decision is evaluated only True or only False, it shall be reported
as only partially covered.

When a decision is evaluated both True and False, no decision coverage
violation shall be reported for it.

The tool shall be able to handle arbitrarily complex decisions in any context
where such expressions might appear, as long as all the logical connectors
operate with short-circuit semantics.

**Testing Strategy**

We check that all the aspects of this requirement are satisfied
in a variety of situations:

* With expressions of different shapes placed in various contexts, to
  verify the tool's capability to handle arbitrary expressions everywhere
  they might appear [ShapesAndContexts];

* With expressions involving different kinds of operands, not only straight
  Boolean variables [Operands].

We exercise each decision of interest in multiple manners, always including

* a set of vectors where the decision evaluates only True,

* a set of vectors where the decision evaluates only False,

* a set of vectors where the decision evaluates both True and False,

* a situation where the statements exposing the decision aren't
  executed at all.
