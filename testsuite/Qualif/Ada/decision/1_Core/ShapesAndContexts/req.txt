Decision coverage assessments shall recognize arbitrary expression shapes
placed in arbitrary contexts.

**Testing Strategy**

We exercise

* A range of boolean expressions over boolean variables, each in a
  representative set of regular program contexts where such expressions might
  appear [AndThen, OrElse, Flip, Value]

* Simple expressions in particular contexts [NoEval, Preconditions]
