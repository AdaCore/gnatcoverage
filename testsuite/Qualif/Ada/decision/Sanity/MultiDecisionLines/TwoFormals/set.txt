This section groups testcases where two distinct decisions are used as actuals
for two boolean formal subprogram arguments.

Expression variants are issued over two dimensions: "and then" vs "or else",
and operand-set-1 vs operand-set-2, with cases where

* Expressions are the same, Operand sets are the same [AndAB_AndAB],
* Expressions are the same, Operand sets are different [AndAB_AndCD],
* Expressions are different, Operand sets are the same [AndAB_OrAB],
* Expressions are different, Operand sets are different [AndAB_OrCD].

In all the cases, we exercise combinations of situations where each decision
evaluates

* True only,
* False only, 
* both True and False.
