This section groups testcases where two distinct decisions are used as actuals
for two boolean formal subprogram arguments.

Expression variants are issued over two dimensions: "and then" vs "or else",
and operand-set-1 vs operand-set-2 [AndAB_AndAB, AndAB_AndCD, AndAB_OrAB,
AndAB_OrCD].

In all the cases, we exercise combinations of situations where each decision
evaluates only True, only False, or both True and False.
