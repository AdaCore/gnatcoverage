Exercise a simple If statement, within a While loop/If statement/Case statement nesting
=======================================================================================

Exercise a simple If statement nested in one of the alternatives of a
Case statement, itself contained in an outer If statement that is inside
a While loop.

We implement a double testing strategy, with:

* Statement coverage-oriented scenarios, exercising SC possibilities (loop
  entered or not, If part of an If statement reached or not, Case statement
  alternatives reached or not, ...)  and combinations of these.

* Decision coverage-oriented scenarios, exercising DC possibilities
  (a given decision True only, False only, or both True and False) and
  combinations of these.
