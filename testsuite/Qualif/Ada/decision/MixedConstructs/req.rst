DC requirements for mixed statement and decision constructs
===========================================================

DC requirements for combinations of statement and decision constructs
representative of application code.



Correct coverage is reported for programs that use a combination of
Ada constructs, with arbitrary levels of syntactic nesting
(such as loops within IFs within subprograms).


.. rubric:: Testing Strategy



We exercise multiple cases with a variety of
constructs nested within each other (FOR, WHILE, CASE, IF), and for each case
verify the behavior in a wide range of contexts:

* Loops, entered or not,

* Possible case selections taken alone or combined with others,

* IF statements that only evaluate to true, that only evaluate to False
  or that evaluate to both values,

* Combinations of these allowed by the nesting structure.
