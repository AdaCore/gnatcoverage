Exercise a toplevel If statement with an else sequence embedding a For loop,
whose body features an inner If statement that controls access to a Case
statement eventually.

Check variations over the outer If control, the For loop entry, the inner If
control, and the possible Case selections, first independently from each other
and then combined together.
