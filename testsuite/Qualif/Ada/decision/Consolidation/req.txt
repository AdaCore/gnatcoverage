Material to define and validate the expected processing of multiple execution
traces combined together.

%(req)s

When the coverage achieved by multiple execution traces is evaluated, a

all the traces individually.

%(tstrat)s

We exercise consolidation of traces obtained for single vector invocations
over a range of basic decisions.

We check all the possible combinations of inputs without repetitions.
