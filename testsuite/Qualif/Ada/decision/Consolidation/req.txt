Define and validate the expected processing of multiple execution
traces combined together.

%(req-headline)s

When the coverage achieved by multiple execution traces is evaluated, a
decision coverage violation shall only be reported when it would have been for
all the traces individually.

%(tstrategy-headline)s

We exercise consolidation of traces obtained for single vector invocations
over a range of basic decisions.

For each decision, first run with every possible relevant input vector
independently, then check all the possible combinations of those input
vectors without repetitions.
