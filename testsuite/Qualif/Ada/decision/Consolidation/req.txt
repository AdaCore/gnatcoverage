When the coverage achieved by multiple execution traces is evaluated, a
decision coverage violation shall only be reported when it would have been for
all the traces individually.

**Testing Strategy**

We exercise consolidation of traces obtained for single vector invocations
over a range of basic decisions.

We check all the possible combinations of inputs without repetitions.
