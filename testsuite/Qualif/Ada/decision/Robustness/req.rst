DC expectations with respect to potentially confusing constructs,
=================================================================

DC expectations with respect to potentially confusing constructs,
e.g. decisions spanning multiple lines.


Requirement(s)
--------------



The Core Decision Coverage requirements shall remain satisfied in presence of
constructs that could fool simple minded analyzers.


Testing Strategy
----------------



Check a panel of cases where code construct particularities could concievably
cause inaccuracies or errors in coverage diagnostics if the tool were to
implement too simple analysis schemes:


.. qmlink:: TCIndexImporter
