**Exercise SC+DC on lines with decisions and multiple statements**

Verify that Statement and Decision coverage assessments are correct in
situations multiple statements, some involving decisions, are present on a
single line.

Check various cases where simple and complex decisions are used to
control execution of statements on the line, and where the inner code
might also feature decisions, e.g. as actuals to subprogram calls.
