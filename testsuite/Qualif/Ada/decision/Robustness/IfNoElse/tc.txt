Exercise a simple If statement, without an Else or Elsif part, controlled
with a simple decision, and followed by a simple assignment statement.

Verify that results match expectations when the If control evaluates True
only, False only, then both True and False. This ensures that the mere
execution status of the unconditioned statement following the If doesn't fool
the tool's perception of the decision valuation.
