Proper recognition of independent simple nested constructs
===========================================================

Check that the tool properly distinguishes independent simple nested
constructs. Exercise a simple If statement, without an Else or Elsif part,
nested within an outer one, with both Ifs controlled by independent conditions.

Check all the possible combinations of True-only/False-only/both values for
the outer and inner conditions.
