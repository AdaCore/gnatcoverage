Exercise a simple If statement, without an Else or Elsif part, nested within
another one, with both Ifs controlled by independant conditions. Check all the
possible combinations of True-only/False-only/both valuations of the outer and
inner conditions.

This checks that the tool properly distinguishes independant simple nested
constructs.
