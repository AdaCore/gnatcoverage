Check that valuations of an inner condition operands don't fool the tool's
assessment of that decision coverage when the corresponding inner statement is
not executed.

Exercise a simple If statement, without an Else or Elsif part, nested within
another one, with both Ifs controlled by independant conditions. Verify that
results match expectations for all the possible combinations of
True-only/False-only/both valuations of the outer and inner conditions.
