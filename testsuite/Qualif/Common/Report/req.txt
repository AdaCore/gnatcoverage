qDescribe the tool output report format and check compliance to it

%(req-headline)s

The tool qualified output is the synthetic report produced by the
--annotate=report command line option. The output report shall:

* Start with an explicit "COVERAGE REPORT" indication

* End with an explicit "END OF REPORT" indication

* Feature up to four sections in between: "Assessment Context", "Coverage
  violations", "Exempted Regions" if any such region was declared in the
  sources of interest, and "Analysis summary"

* The "Assessment Context" section shall summarize all the elements
  of relevance to characterize the reported assessment unambiguously:

  * Tool version identifier

  * Date and time of execution

  * Full command line issued to produce the report

  * Coverage criteria assessed (e.g. "stmt" or "stmt+decision")

  * Information about each of the input trace files:

    * trace tag & file name
    * trace production date & time
    * program executable file name

* The "Non-exempted violations" section shall feature a set of subsections,
  one for each criterion assessed with

  * A list of all the criterion obligations unsatisfied (violated) by
    the set of executions conveyed by the provided execution traces, and

  * A count of those violations

* The "Exempted Regions" section shall

  * Summarize information about all the exemption regions in the scope of the
    examined coverage obligations, and

  * End with a count of those regions

* The "Analysis summary" section shall expose

  * A single synthetic line for each coverage criterion assessed, with a count
    of the non-exempted violations of that particular criterion.
  
  * A single synthetic line providing the count of exempted regions.

We provide testcases to check that the reports produced by the tool satisfy
the requirements in a range of different situations:

%(tc-index)s

We validate the presence and structure of all the expected sections and items
in each testcase. We do not validate the correctness of the section contents
here. That assessment (correctness of the reported violations vs expectations
for particular programs), is defined and validated by sibling chapters of this
qualification material.
