**Check gnatcov run -P on a project file with a Main attribute listing a single main unit**

Verify that gnatcov run can figure out the name of the program to
execute from a Main attribute listing a single main in the root
project file.

Verify that providing the name of an executable on the command
line overrules the attribute.
