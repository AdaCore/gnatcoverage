Stating Units Of Interest
=========================

The tool supports two ways of stating the Units Of Interest
for an alaysis, which define the set of source units for which
coverage achievements shall be assessed:

* Using GPR project files, *or*

* Providing explicit sets of files carrying Source Coverage Obligations.

We develop a separate requirement for each:

.. qmlink:: SubsetIndexImporter

   GPR
   SCOS
