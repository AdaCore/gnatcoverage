"""
Check that gnatcov complains on missing ALI/SID file.

This runs gnatcov on a simple project that contains two units: main and helper.
Both units are standalone procedures (i.e. mains with no dependency), but only
"main" is declared as a main in the project file, so gprbuild does not compile
helper.

Since helper is not compiled, no ALI/SID file is created for it. However it is
still a unit of interest for gnatcov, so we expect gnatcov to complain about
a missing information file.
