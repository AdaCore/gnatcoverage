Check the selection of Units Of Interest by project file attributes
===================================================================

For a simple example comprising multiple functional units exercised by
several independent test drivers, and a single project file, exercise
combinations of attributes in the Coverage package to include/exclude
units from the set "of interest" and verify for each case that

- Expected reports are there, conveying expected coverage results
  for each of the test drivers,

- No other report is there.
