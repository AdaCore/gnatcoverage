"""
Expose the topology definition and instanciation engine.

A topology is used to specify the pattern of a decision: X and (not Y or Z),
for instance, is such a pattern, built from a boolean expression and
placeholders.

Once a topology is defined, it can be instanciated to a full decision
expression: to do so, placeholders are replaced by "operand" expressions.
