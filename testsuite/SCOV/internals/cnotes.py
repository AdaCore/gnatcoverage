# ****************************************************************************

# What we refer to as or "coverage notes" are abstractions of expected or
# emitted coverage indications.

# We call "Line" or "L" notes the synthetic signs emitted on a line in the
# =xcov outputs, for example, the '+' or '-' signs in the sample below:
#
#   1 .: function In_Range (X , Min, Max : Integer) return Boolean is
#   2 .: begin
#   3 +:    if X < Min then
#   4 -:       return False;
#   5 +:    elsif X > Max then
#   6 -:       return False;
#   7 .:    else
#   8 +:       return True;
#   9 .:    end if;
#  10 .: end;
#
# Lnote objects convey the kind of information emitted ("line fully covered"
# for '+', "line not covered" for '-') and the line number for which it was
# emitted. They are collected in outer data structures (e.g. dictionaries) to
# bind them with the source file where they were found.

# We call "Report", or "R" notes the indications emitted for slocs in the
# =report outputs, for example:
#
#  in_range.adb:4:7: statement not executed
#  in_range.adb:6:7: statement not executed
#
# As for Lnotes, Rnote objects convey the kind of indication emitted, the sloc
# for which they were emitted, and are gathered in outer data structures to
# bind them with the source file from which they originate. Different possible
# degrees of precision could be present in the source location designation:
#
#   * for a specific point in the source, e.g. "4:5" for "column 5 on line #4"
#   * for a line as a whole, e.g. "4" or "4:0" for "line #4",
#   * for a line segment, e.g. "4:7-9" for "columns 7 to 9 on line #4"
#   * for a section of source spanning multiple lines,
#     e.g. "3:4-9:7" for "column #4 on line #3 to column #7 on line #9",
#
# To let us evaluate if some reported coverage indication corresponds to an
# expectation, we abstract all these with variations over sloc SECTIONS which
# we can easily check for inclusion within each other. We manipulate general
# sloc SECTIONS, possibly specialized as line SEGMENTs (section with start and
# end on the same line) or full LINEs (segment from first to last column) or
# POINTs (one column segments).

# Expected indications are expressed as comments in single test drivers, like:
#
# -- test_blob1.adb --
# procedure test_blob1 is
# begin
#   ...
# end;
#
# --# blob.adb       <= start of expectations for unit blob.adb
#
#       o------------- "line regular expression"
#       |    o--------- expected Line note for matching lines
#       |    |     o--- set of expected Report notes for matching lines
#       |    |     |
#       v    v     v
# --  /foo/  l- ## s-   <= for lines matching "-- # foo", expect
#                          a '-' synthetic note on the =xcov line (l-)
#                          a 'statement not covered' =report indication (s-)
#
# --  /bar/  l+ ## 0    <= for lines matching "-- # bar", expect
#                          a '+' synthetic note on the =xcov line (l+)
#                          no =report indication (0 = empty set)
# --# otherunit.adb
# --  ...
#
# We typically use 'X' in names to denote eXpectation, so will typically
# have Xnote objects to represent the set of expected indications after
# the line patterns were matched against a source.

# For =report outputs, violation expectations, such as "s-", map one-to-one
# with some indication we ought to find in a coverage assessment report.
#
# Conversely, the "0" empty set denotes the expectation of an absence of
# reported violations, corresonding to a full set of possible indications.
#
# We qualify "0" as an anti-expectation.

# Transient kinds: these may be used in expectations and should always be
# subject to substitution rules mapping them to other kinds. No emitted note
# will ever match them. These are useful for shared drivers when the actual
# kind of expectation depends on the functional code.

# Expression vs Control decisions:

# otNoCov  : outcome True not covered (=report)
# ofNoCov  : outcome False not covered (=report)
# oPartCov : one outcome not covered (=report)
# oNoCov   : outcome never evaluated (=report)

# Exempted violations. These are a subset of the violations described above
# that are possible to find in exempted blocks. They have the same meaning but
# are simply prefixed by an uppercase 'X' to express that they can only be
# found in exempted regions. The relevant notes are:
#
# XsNoCov, XsPartCov, XsNotCoverable, XsUndetCov, XotNoCov, XofNoCov,
# XoPartCov, XoNoCov, XcPartCov, r0, r0c

# Annotations lower than strictNote won't trigger an unexpected annotation
# failure if they appear in a place where they are not explicitly expected.

    we have one _line_ note emitted for each line of the block, one _report_
    block note emitted for the entire region and one _report_ note for each
    exempted violation within the region. For example:

    foo.adb.xcov:
        2 *:   pragma Annotate (Exempt_On, "comment"); -- # ex-region
        3 *:   if Debug then                           -- # ex-region-test

        foo.adb:3:7 decision outcome True never exercised
        foo.adb:4:7 statement not executed

    In expectation blocks, the line intended to match the emitted report block
    note for the entire region is typically designed to match on all the lines
    of the region to capture the sloc range. For example:

    --# foo.adb
    --# /ex-region/ l* ## x1

    This matches all the lines, from 2 to 6, and creates a "l*" line note
    expectation for each line that is indeed discharged by the .xcov output.

    Now we need additional expectations for the emitted violation _report_
    notes, and we need to prevent these from creating new line notes
    expectations that would never be discharged. On our example, this would be
    achieved with:

    --# /ex-region-test l= ## dT-
    --# /ex-region-bump l= ## s-

    where the "l=" expectation is "transparent".
