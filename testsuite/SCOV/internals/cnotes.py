# ****************************************************************************

# What we refer to as or "coverage notes" are abstractions of expected or
# emitted coverage indications.

# We call "Line" or "L" notes the synthetic signs emitted on a line in the
# =xcov outputs, for example, the '+' or '-' signs in the sample below:
#
#   1 .: function In_Range (X , Min, Max : Integer) return Boolean is
#   2 .: begin
#   3 +:    if X < Min then
#   4 -:       return False;
#   5 +:    elsif X > Max then
#   6 -:       return False;
#   7 .:    else
#   8 +:       return True;
#   9 .:    end if;
#  10 .: end;
#
# Lnote objects convey the kind of information emitted ("line fully covered"
# for '+', "line not covered" for '-') and the line number for which it was
# emitted. They are collected in outer data structures (e.g. dictionaries) to
# bind them with the source file where they were found.

# We call "Report", or "R" notes the indications emitted for slocs in the
# =report outputs, for example:
#
#  in_range.adb:4:7: statement not executed
#  in_range.adb:6:7: statement not executed
#
# As for Lnotes, Rnote objects convey the kind of indication emitted, the sloc
# for which they were emitted, and are gathered in outer data structures to
# bind them with the source file from which they originate. Different possible
# degrees of precision could be present in the source location designation:
#
#   * for a specific point in the source, e.g. "4:5" for "column 5 on line #4"
#   * for a line as a whole, e.g. "4" or "4:0" for "line #4",
#   * for a line segment, e.g. "4:7-9" for "columns 7 to 9 on line #4"
#   * for a section of source spanning multiple lines,
#     e.g. "3:4-9:7" for "column #4 on line #3 to column #7 on line #9",
#
# To let us evaluate if some reported coverage indication corresponds to an
# expectation, we abstract all these with variations over sloc SECTIONS which
# we can easily check for inclusion within each other. We manipulate general
# sloc SECTIONS, possibly specialized as line SEGMENTs (section with start and
# end on the same line) or full LINEs (segment from first to last column) or
# POINTs (one column segments).

# Expected indications are expressed as comments in single test drivers, like:
#
# -- test_blob1.adb --
# procedure test_blob1 is
# begin
#   ...
# end;
#
# --# blob.adb       <= start of expectations for unit blob.adb
#
#       o------------- "line regular expression"
#       |    o--------- expected Line note for matching lines
#       |    |     o--- set of expected Report notes for matching lines
#       |    |     |
#       v    v     v
# --  /foo/  l- ## s-   <= for lines matching "-- # foo", expect
#                          a '-' synthetic note on the =xcov line (l-)
#                          a 'statement not covered' =report indication (s-)
#
# --  /bar/  l+ ## 0    <= for lines matching "-- # bar", expect
#                          a '+' synthetic note on the =xcov line (l+)
#                          no =report indication (0 = empty set)
# --# otherunit.adb
# --  ...
#
# We typically use 'X' in names to denote eXpectation, so will typically
# have Xnote objects to represent the set of expected indications after
# the line patterns were matched against a source.

# For =report outputs, violation expectations, such as "s-", map one-to-one
# with some indication we ought to find in a coverage assessment report.
#
# Conversely, the "0" empty set denotes the expectation of an absence of
# reported violations, corresonding to a full set of possible indications.
#
# We qualify "0" as an anti-expectation.

# Symbolic values & names for kinds of coverage notes:
# ----------------------------------------------------

# lNoCode       : no code for line (=xcov)
# lNotCoverable : no code but statement on line, hence not coverable (=xcov)
# lFullCov      : full coverage for line (=xcov)
# r0            : expect empty set of violations (=report)
# r0c           : like r0, on a statement continuation line (=report)
# lx0           : line part of exempted block, 0 deviations (=xcov)
# lx1           : line part of exempted block, >0 deviations (=xcov)
# lNoCov        : line not covered (=xcov)
# lPartCov      : line partially covered (=xcov)

# sNotCoverable : no code but statement on line, hence not coverable (=report)
# sNoCov        : stmt not covered (=report)
# sPartCov      : unable to assess precise stmt coverage (=report)

# dtAlways : decision is always True, hence not coverable (=report)
# dfAlways : decision is always False, hence not coverable (=report)
# dtNoCov  : decision outcome True not covered (=report)
# dfNoCov  : decision outcome False not covered (=report)
# dPartCov : one decision outcome not covered (=report)
# dNoCov   : decision never evaluated (=report)

# etNoCov  : expression outcome True not covered (=report)
# efNoCov  : expression outcome False not covered (=report)
# ePartCov : one expression outcome not covered (=report)
# eNoCov   : expression never evaluated (=report)

# cPartCov : independent effect of condition not demonstrated (=report)

# xBlock0  : exempted block, 0 deviations (=report)
# xBlock1  : exempted block, >0 deviations (=report)

# Transient kinds: these may be used in expectations and should always be
# subject to substitution rules mapping them to other kinds. No emitted note
# will ever match them. These are useful for shared drivers when the actual
# kind of expectation depends on the functional code.

# Expression vs Control decisions:

# otNoCov  : outcome True not covered (=report)
# ofNoCov  : outcome False not covered (=report)
# oPartCov : one outcome not covered (=report)
# oNoCov   : outcome never evaluated (=report)

# Annotations lower than strictNote won't trigger an unexpected annotation
# failure if they appear in a place where they are not explicitly expected.
