This directory hosts libraries of test drivers and functional
code for expressions of a given topology. Ideas:

o One family of drivers for e.g.

    X and then Y
    X or else Y
    etc

o State expectations for all the possible criteria
  (stmt, decision, mcdc)

o Provide helpers + functional code for a variety
  of operand kinds. Drivers should be generic enough
  not to care.

o Each chapter should feature a "instanciation"
  request to trigger execution of the test and validation
  for the criterion it represents.

o think about ways to have the tests accounted for in qualification runs
  (if not in a subdir of <lang>/<crit> for example)

DriverLib
  Drivers written in Ada, used for C instances as well

Ada/ExprLib
  Ada implementation of the helpers and functional variants

C/ExprLib
  C implementation of the helpers and functional variants

Testcase description:
  Check correctness of _the criterion_ assessment etc
