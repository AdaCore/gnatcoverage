--  This tests the fixes that makes gnatcov pass the architecture-specific
--  compiler switches (-m*) to:
--
--    1. the compilation of buffer units,
--    2. the compilation of buffer list units,
--    3. the partial linking command that merges object files for the buffer
--       unit and the corresponding "user" unit.
--
--  Since 1 and 2 are just data units (they contain no subprogram), the only
--  switch that is relevant in this context is "-m32" from x86_64 toolchains,
--  so running this test makes no sense in other contexts.
