"""
Check that gnatcov correctly discards coverage data for a compilation unit
version that conflicts with a previously loaded version. Note: the use of the
TestCase driver framework matters here, as if we do not discard source coverage
obligations (those coming from bar.h, or foo.h: it does not really matter
which), we end up with four coverage obligations in foo.h, and thus four
violations. This is actually checked through the report format check by the
TestCase framework.
