"""
Regression test: check that gnatcov does not process headers in the context of
the manual dump trigger preprocessing. To do that, put a #pragma once in a
header, and instrument with -Werror.

Also checks that it puts the right external linkage prefix for a C++ file (e.g.
extern "C"), as otherwise the dependency is not resolved at link time as
gnatcov declares the dump/reset procedures as C symbols.
