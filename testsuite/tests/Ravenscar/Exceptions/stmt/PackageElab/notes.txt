Check for exception raised during package elaboration:

We check:
   Package elaborations in which the exceptions are raised and
   handled within the same subprogram. These packages specs can appear
   in a simple block, or a nexted block. The exceptions are either
   handled immediately or propagated to an outer block within the same
   subprogram.

   Package elaborations in which the exceptions are propagated and
   handled by another (calling) subprogram. We test exceptions raised
   in library units and exceptions that are raised within a nested
   subprogram. User defined as well as predefined (implicit and explicit)
   exceptions are tested.
