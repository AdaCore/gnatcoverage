In the hierarchy of a (tagged) derived types, call inherited subprograms and
subprograms that overrides the implicitly inherited operations.

Verify that:

* If an implicitly declared inherited subprogram is called, only (a part of)
  the code of the explicitly declared subprogram it is inherited from is
  reported as covered;

* If an explicitly declared subprogram that overrides the implicitly
  inherited subprogram is called, the code of the overriding subprogram is
  reported as covered, but not the code of the subprogram being overridden;
