The following things should be checked:

1. If a decision in some control structure contains a call to a dispatching
   operation as one of the conditions involved then the coverage information
   is correctly computed for this construct in case of dynamic binding.

2. If a decision in some control structure contains a call to a class-wide
   operation (containing some dynamic dispatching in its body) as one of the
   conditions involved then the coverage information is correctly computed for
   this construct in case of dynamic binding.

3. For the body of a class-wide operation, the coverage information is
   correctly computed.

4. For the body a dispatching operation the coverage information is correctly
   computed in case of a dynamic binding.

For the initial version of the test suite, the simplest form is used for each
decision - it contains exactly one condition. The other parts of the test
suite exercises complex decisions, and here we check only things specific to
Ada OO features.
