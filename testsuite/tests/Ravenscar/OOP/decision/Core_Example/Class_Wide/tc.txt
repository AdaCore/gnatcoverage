Check DC when a class-wide operation is called (not as a condition of some
decision). DC is checked for the code of the dispatching operation itself and
for the code of dispatching operations that can be called by the class-wide
operation. The class-wide operation contains an IF statement (with ELSE part
and with no ELSIF part). The tests are structured according to the
coverage of the decision in this IF statement.
