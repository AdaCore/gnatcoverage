Check DC when a dispatching operation is called (not as a condition of some
decision, but on its own), and the called subprogram cannot be detected
statically. DC is checked for the code of the dispatching operation itself and
for the code of dispatching operations that can be called by it. The tests are
structured according to the coverage of the decision in this IF statements in
the dispatching operations being executed.
