The and/or/xor non-shortcircuit operators are allowed for sc and dc
assessments. They shall be processed as any other kind of computational
operator.

Testing Strategy:
-----------------

Provide testcases involving and/or/xor operators in decisions. Check
that they are all accepted and processed without any particularity.

Check that the presence of and/or/xor operators in an expression
doesn't make it a decision out of explicit control-flow contexts.
