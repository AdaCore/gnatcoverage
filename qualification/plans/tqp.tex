\chapter{Tool overview}
\section {Sought certification credit}
DO-178 requires to measure test coverage of software structure as part of the Software Verification Process. Measure of test coverage is mandatory for level A, B, C. Level A requires to achieve at least \mcdc, \dc and \stc (table A7 objective 5-7); level B requires to achieve at least \dc and \stc (table A7 objective 6-7) and level C requires to achieve at least \stc (table A7 objective 7). In the case of level A software, and if the compilers generates un-traceable object code, additional verification may be required on object code. CAST Paper 17 suggests at least two possible activities to achieve this additional objective: to measure test coverage of object code and to develop a traceability study on a representative set of source code.

\xcov aims at automating the measurement of activities above. In the case of level A software, \xcov also aims at automating the measurement of test coverage of object code if this strategy has been chosen to cope with un-traceable object code.

\xcov is qualified as a \emph{verification tool} or, in DO-178C terms, with a Tool Qualification Level 3 (TQL3). As such, and as long as \xcov is used following its qualified interface (see section \ref{sec:qual-interface}), applicants may use \xcov output as certification evidence and certification authorities shall consider \xcov output \emph{as good as} the output of a manual activity.

\section{Tool development and verification standards}
\subsection{Tool Operational Requirements}
A physical folder on the repository is associated to each TOR. The name of the folder is the id of the TOR. All qualification artifacts derived from a TOR are stored as either files or folders contained in the folder of the parent TOR. The TOR textual specification is contained in a file always named \texttt{req.txt}.

\subsection{Test cases}
Explicit description of test cases (when necessary) is contained in the \texttt{req.txt} of the parent TOR under the section "Testing strategy". Source code for test cases is contained in the \texttt{src} sub-folder and source files do \emph{not} start with the \texttt{test\_} prefix. 

\subsection{Tests source code}
Source code for tests is contained in the \texttt{src} sub-folder; source files start with the \texttt{test\_} prefix. 

\section{Production of qualification data}

\subsection{Environment equivalence}
\label{sec:equivalence}
For the whole set of qualification material to be consistent, the qualification and user environments must be equivalent. Given our internal knowledge of \xcov, we deem the following data sufficient to establish equivalence of environments:
\begin{enumerate}
\item the name of the GNAT Pro executable;
\item the GNAT Pro version number;
\item the \xcov version number;
\item the host operating system and its version;
\end{enumerate}
The value for all the items above for the qualification environment are contained in the delivery file (section \ref{sec:delivery}). Test execution results are produced in an environment which is equivalent to the one described in the delivery file.

\subsection{Specific constraints and open problems}
\label{sec:constr-problems}
All known constraints and open problems are collected in the appropriate file as per section \ref{sec:qd-overview}.

\subsection{Delivery file}
\label{sec:delivery}
The delivery file (as per section \ref{sec:qd-overview}) contains the description of the qualification environments following the data required by section \ref{sec:equivalence}.
