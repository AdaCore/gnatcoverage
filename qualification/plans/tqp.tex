\chapter{Tool and document overview}

\section{Tool overview}
\xcov is a tool conceived to measure test coverage of software structures at both source code level. Differently from most common coverage tools, \xcov operates without instrumenting the source code. It also allows using the same (cross) compiler used in the development environment to produce the final executable to be deployed on the target hardware. \xcov relies on:
\begin{itemize}
\item the list of object instructions evaluated within the execution of a (set of) test(s): such a list is collected by \xcov itself; 
\item the ability of the compiler to produce a map between source code structures (statements, decisions, conditions) and the corresponding object code instructions.
\end{itemize}
By analysing the data above, \xcov is thus able to calculate which source code structures have been executed.

Additional information on the high \xcov can be found in the \xcov UG and in \adaeurope and \erts.

\section {Sought certification credit}
DO-178 requires to measure test coverage of software structure as part of the Software Verification Process. Measure of test coverage is mandatory for level A, B, C. Level A requires to achieve at least \mcdc, \dc and \stc (table A7 objective 5-7); level B requires to achieve at least \dc and \stc (table A7 objective 6-7) and level C requires to achieve at least \stc (table A7 objective 7). \xcov aims at automating the measurement of activities above.

\xcov is qualified as a \emph{verification tool} or, in DO-178C terms, with a Tool Qualification Level 5 (TQL5). As such, and as long as \xcov is used following its qualified interface (see section \ref{sec:qual-interface}), applicants may use \xcov output as certification evidence and certification authorities shall consider \xcov output \emph{as good as} the output of a manual activity.

\section{Qualified interface}
\label{sec:qual-interface}
For \xcov to produce reports valid as certification material, the tool shall be used following these process:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Build the executable application using the GNAT Pro executable identified in the delivery file (see section \ref{sec:delivery}) and accordingly to the known constraints for compilation options (see section \ref{sec:constr-problems}).

\item Execute on the command line the following command:\\

\texttt{xcov run --target=<TARGET> --level=<LEVEL> <EXECUTABLE>} \\

where:
\begin{itemize}
\item <TARGET> is the target platform (the same used in the GNAT Pro executable name, for example, powerpc-elf).
\item <LEVEL> is the targeted DO-178 criticality level, univocally identifying which coverage metrics are activated.
\item <EXECUTABLE> is the executable file produced at point 1.
\end{itemize}

This step produces two files:
\begin{itemize}
\item traces.list, a list of files containing the execution trace to examine
\item alis.list, the list of files for which we want coverage results.
\end{itemize}

\item Execute on the command line the following command:\\

\texttt{xcov coverage --scoc=@alis.list --level=<LEVEL> --anotate=report @traces.list -o <REPORT>} \\

where:

\begin{itemize}
\item <LEVEL> is the targeted DO-178 criticality level as per point 2.
\item <REPORT> is the file where the qualified coverage report is generated.
\end{itemize}.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Tool development and verification standards}
\subsection{Tool Operational Requirements}
A physical folder on the repository is associated to each TOR. The name of the folder is the id of the TOR. All qualification artifacts derived from a TOR are stored as either files or folders contained in the folder of the parent TOR. The TOR textual specification is contained in a file always named \texttt{req.txt}.

\subsection{Test cases}
Explicit description of test cases (when necessary) is contained in the \texttt{req.txt} of the parent TOR under the section "Testing strategy". Source code for test cases is contained in the \texttt{src} sub-folder and source files do \emph{not} start with the \texttt{test\_} prefix. 

\subsection{Tests source code}
Source code for tests is contained in the \texttt{src} sub-folder; source files start with the \texttt{test\_} prefix. 

\section{Production of qualification data}

\subsection{Environment equivalence}
\label{sec:equivalence}
For the whole set of qualification material to be consistent, the qualification and user environments must be equivalent. Given our internal knowledge of \xcov, we deem the following data sufficient to establish equivalence of environments:
\begin{enumerate}
\item the name of the GNAT Pro executable;
\item the GNAT Pro version number;
\item the \xcov version number;
\item the host operating system and its version;
\end{enumerate}
The value for all the items above for the qualification environment are contained in the delivery file (section \ref{sec:delivery}). Test execution results are produced in an environment which is equivalent to the one described in the delivery file. 

\subsection{Tool Operational Requirements}
We identify three different kinds of tool operational requirements, each of which focusing on a distinct aspect:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Coverage of specific source code structures in isolation.} This category of TORs focuses on the users' expectations for the coverage of specific source code structures with respect to a specific coverage metric. We are interested in assessing that \xcov correctly acknowledges cases of absence of (or partial) coverage. In other terms, we focus on assessing \xcov is \emph{sound}. For this reason, requirements of this category shall target a specific element of a programming language (if statements, loop, blocks, etc.) and express under which conditions coverage is \emph{not} achieved. A simplified example is: \emph{"An if statement whose governing decision is evaluated to just True shall be reported as non covered for decision coverage."}. Each requirement shall target a single structure only. The use of programming language reference manuals provides a significant contribution in identifying the structure of interest.

\item \textbf{Coverage of multiple source code structures.} This category of TORs is an extension of the one above and takes into consideration several different code structures at once. The goal is to assess that \xcov reports are sound also when the tool is used on complex programs. It is clearly not reasonable to take into account all possible combinations of all possible structures because this would lead to an exponential increase of the number of test cases. We thus use a reasonably complex embedded application and its associated test suite as a way to verify \xcov behaviour.

\item \textbf{Representativeness of coverage results.} Since \xcov executes the application and its test suite on an execution platform other than the final operational hardware, we also consider specific TORs intended to provide evidence that the \xcov-driven execution of an application is equivalent to its execution on the final hardware. Such TORs focus on comparing the output of the same executable when executed via \xcov and on the final target processor.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Test cases}
Test cases reflect the different kinds of tool operational requirements.
\begin{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Coverage of specific source code structures in isolation.} Test cases for this kind of TORs exercise the same structure differently, for example by causing a boolean expression to be evaluated just to True or False.

\item \textbf{Coverage of multiple source code structures.} Test cases for this kind of TORs are characterized by the execution of a selected subset of a test suite for an embedded application. 

\item \textbf{Representativeness of coverage results.} These test cases consider all executables produced for the previous kind of test cases and compare their \xcov-driven execution with the execution on the target hardware. 

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Specific constraints and open problems}
\label{sec:constr-problems}
All known constraints and open problems are collected in the appropriate file as per section \ref{sec:qd-overview}. They include constraints on GNAT Pro compilation options and on coding standard accepted by \xcov.

\subsection{Delivery file}
\label{sec:delivery}
The delivery file (as per section \ref{sec:qd-overview}) contains:
\begin{itemize} 
\item the description of the qualification environments following the data required by section \ref{sec:equivalence}.
\item the version of all the files listed in section \ref{sec:qd-overview} as part of the qualification data.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{User activities}
\label{sec:user-act}
The user needs to perform a set of activities, either in the scope of \xcov qualification or \xcov usage.

\section{\xcov qualification}
To finalise the qualification of \xcov, the user needs to:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Reference \xcov in the PSAC}, identifying \xcov as a verification tool requiring qualification because it contributes to take certification credit by automating some (otherwise manual) activities.
\item \textbf{Assess the equivalence between the qualification environment and the operational environment} (see section \ref{sec:equivalence}).
\item \textbf{Put qualification data under configuration management}.
\end{enumerate}

\section{\xcov usage}
The user needs to perform the following activities to assure \xcov exhibits a qualified behaviour:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Install \xcov in the Operational Environment}.
\item \textbf{Check \xcov is used following its qualified interface} (see section \ref{sec:qual-interface}) when the tool output is intended to be used to take certification credit.
\item \textbf{Check \xcov is used in a way compliant to its known constraints and open problems} (see section \ref{sec:constr-problems}) when the tool output is intended to be used to take certification credit.
\item \textbf{Update the Environment Configuration Index} by including the delivery file and test results (see section \ref{sec:qd-overview} for the corresponding files).
\item \textbf{Update the Software Accomplishment Summary} for:
\begin{itemize}
\item Objectives 5, 6 and 7 of table A7 for level A software.
\item Objectives 6 and 7 of table A7 for level B software.
\item Objective 7 of table A7 for level C software.
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Update the Software Accomplishment Summary} for the qualification status of \xcov.
\end{enumerate}
