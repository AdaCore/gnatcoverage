To run the QM:

* Download a recent wavefront (synchronize with the QM team for that)
* Unzip it (if on Windows) or untar it (on Unix). The created directory will be
  denoted by <qmachine_prefix>. You can safely move it to any convenient
  location.
* Make sure the bin directory is in your PATH:
  on unix: export PATH=<qmachine_prefix>/bin:$PATH
  on windows: right click on start menu->computer, select properties,
   select advanced properties, environment variables, update the PATH definition
   or define it to <qmachine_prefix>\bin;%PATH%
* In the directory containing this README file, using the command line:
  - To run the qmachine with the GUI (requires gnatpython):

    ./genmodel.py --dolevel=doB
    qmachine model.xml

  - To generate the documentation (html and pdf)

    qmachine model.xml -l scripts/generate_[tor|plans]_[html|pdf].py

    The documentation will be generated in the release folder

Important Note:
In order to generate the PDF, you will need make, and LaTeX installed.
