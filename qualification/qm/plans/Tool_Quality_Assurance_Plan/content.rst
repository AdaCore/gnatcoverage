Tool Quality Assurance Plan
===========================

|project_name| |QA| (QA) proceeds in cycles of activities.

The QA outputs for a kit are stored in a "qa" directory dedicated to the
project for which the kit is produced. The most significant output is the
|tqa_doc| document, ``qa.doc``, where all the QA cycles are tracked.

The responsibility for the |QA| process belongs to the |QA| team.
