Qualification Data overview
===========================

The qualification data that comes with the tool, composing what we refer to as
a *qualification kit*, consists in the following three documents:

* The **PLANS** document, *PLANS.pdf*, which is this document.
* The **TOR** (*Tool Operational Requirements*) document, *TOR.pdf*, which
  contains the description of the tool operational requirements and
  the associated testcases.
* The **STR** (*Software Test Results*) report, *STR.pdf*, which contains a
  synthetic summary of the testsuite run performed to assess the tool
  behavioral correctness with respect to its intended use.
