Tool Overview
=============
GNATcoverage is a tool designed to assess the source level structural coverage achieved by a testing campaign on software. It operates without any instrumentation of the original program, on code generated by the same compiler as the one producing the executable deployed on the target hardware. Detailed information on the tool capabilities and characteristics is available in the GNATcoverage User's Guide as well as in [AE09] and [ERTS2010] papers.
