=======================
Environment Equivalence
=======================

Qualification data are produced both in the qualification and user environments (see see :qmref:`$(parent)::User_Activities`). For the whole set of qualification material to be consistent, the qualification and user environments must thus be equivalent. We deem the following data sufficient to establish equivalence of environments:

#. the GNAT Pro executable name, version number and host operating system;
#. the GNAT Pro compilation switches;
#. the GNATcoverage executable name, version number and host operating system.

If all points above are equal, then the two environments are equivalent.
