============================

#. **Reference** |project_name_bold| **in the Plan for Software Aspects of
   Certification (PSAC) and, if appropriate, in Tool Qualification Plan**.
   The user needs to:

   * identify |project_name| as a TQL-5 tool with regard to software level
     A, B, and C, or with regard to tool qualification level 1, 2, and 3,
     whichever is appropriate, that needs to be qualified;

   * Include references to the |project_name| qualification kit documents that
     were received to support this particular use of the tool.

#. **Delivery Acceptance.** On delivery of |project_name| and its
   qualification kit, the user shall:

   * Assess whether the qualified Operational Environment is
     representative of the user's Operational Environment;

   * Assess whether the structural coverage analysis performed
     by GNATcoverage satisfies the goals specified in the
     :ref:`certification-credit` section;

   * Assess whether the Tool Operational Requirements include suitable
     artifacts for specific language constructs expected to be of relevance
     for a given coverage criterion.

#. **Configuration management of qualification data**. The user needs to place
   all qualification data under configuration management.

#. **Obtain a tool qualification agreement**, see section 9.0.b of
   |tool_standard|.

#. **Update the Software or Tool Life Cycle Environment Configuration Index.**
   Refer to the |project_name| qualification kit for details associated with
   its environment configuration.

#. **Update the Software or Tool Accomplishment Summary (SAS or TAS).**
   The SAS/TAS needs to be updated:

   * For Table A-7 of |standard|: achievement of the objectives 5, 6 and 7,
     depending on the software level; or for Table T-7 of |tool_standard|:
     achievement of the objectives 6, 7 and 8, depending on the qualification
     level (as appropriate).

   * For qualification status of |project_name|: refer to |str_doc| report.
