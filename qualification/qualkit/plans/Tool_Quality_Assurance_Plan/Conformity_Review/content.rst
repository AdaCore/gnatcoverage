Tool Conformity Review
======================

These objectives are achieved in the scope of the tool conformity review:

 * **8.3.a**: Check that tool life cycle data is under configuration
   management and managed as described
 * **8.3.b**: Check that activities of the TQP, TCMP and TQAP are
   completed and have produced the items described
   at :ref:`tcmp`
 * **8.3.c**: Check that problems have been reported and evaluated according to
   the :ref:`tcmp`.
 * **8.3.d**: Record and approve software requirements deviations arising from
   two sources: (1) deviations exposed by test failures reported in the
   |prj_toolset| |str_doc| provided as part of the tool qualification data;
   and (2) deviations due to issues recorded in the known-problems
   file maintained by |adacore| for a given release of |prj_toolset|.
 * **8.3.e**: Check that the tool executable object code can be re-generated
   from the tool source code.
 * **8.3.f**: Check that problems from a previous Tool Conformity Review are
   re-evaluated.
 * **8.3.g**: Not applicable since no credit is sought for the use of
   previously developed tools.
