{\large \textbf{Abstract}}
\end{center}

This document gathers results established or formalized by the Couverture
project team about relationships between specific coverage criteria.
%
We focus in particular on how \E{Object Branch Coverage} (OBC) relates to the
\E{Modified Condition/Decision Coverage} (MCDC) criterion.

We provide two broad categories of results: formal proofs of important
properties over a model of the two criteria, and a machine-automated
verification of some of these properties for concrete subsets of the model
expressed in Alloy.
%
These results constitute the grounds on which our project coverage analysis
framework operates to infer source coverage results from object coverage
information out of an instrumented execution environment.
