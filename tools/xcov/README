This is the README file for the binary distribution of the Xcov coverage
analysis facility.

INSTALL
=======

This distribution can be used standalone, without any specific installation
step after unpacking.  The <unpack-subdir>/bin directory contains the toolset
programs, which you may access by simply adjusting your PATH environment
variable. The <unpack-subdir>/share directory contains the documentation and
examples.

If this is more convenient for you, you may transfer the contents of the "bin"
and "share" subdirectories into their corresponding entries within a
pre-existing installation tree, where a GNAT toolset is located for instance.

USE
===
Using Xcov is documented in the "Xcov Fundamentals & Users Guide" available in
this package, from the <unpack/installation-root>/share/doc/xcov directory.

EXAMPLES
========
Examples are provided in the <installation root>/share/examples/xcov
directory. The "Explore" example is introduced in the user's guide and used
for illustration purposes there.
