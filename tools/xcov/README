This is the README file for the binary distribution of the Xcov coverage
analysis facility.

PACKAGE CONTENTS
================

The package provides the xcov front-end, used both as a wrapper of the
instrumented execution environment (xcov run) and as a trace analyzer
able to render coverage results in various output formats (xcov
coverage).

The instrumented version of Qemu, an open source processor emulator we
use as a program execution environment able to generate execution traces
of the machine code it executes is available in a separate package.

As part of the examples subdirectory, the package also includes:

* A light Qemu Board Support Package to link with your executable to let
  it run within the emulated environment,

* A couple of very basic library components for Ada (simple IO, memory
  copy/set/compare, ...) in case they are not available otherwise,

* A number of example programs you can exercise to get familiar with the
  toolset, with Makefiles to illustrate build/run/analyze sequences.

The "Explore" example is introduced in the user's guide and used for
illustration purposes there. It features both an interactive program and AUnit
based tests for some of the program units.

The "Engines" example is used to provide a quick first contact with the
tools, through the QUICK START section below.

INSTALL
=======
This distribution can be used standalone, without any specific installation
step after unpacking.  The <unpack-subdir>/bin directory contains the toolset
programs, which you may access by simply adjusting your PATH environment
variable. The <unpack-subdir>/share directory contains the documentation and
examples.

If this is more convenient for you, you may transfer the contents of the "bin"
and "share" subdirectories into their corresponding entries within a
pre-existing installation tree, where a GNAT toolset is located for instance.

QUICK START - OBJECT COVERAGE
=============================
A quick starter is the "engines" basic example, assuming you have both your
target compilation toolchain and this package installed.

The first step is to setup the PATH environment variable to include locations
for both the target compiler and the Xcov "bin" directory. For example with a
bash like shell:

  $ PATH=/usr/local/gnat/6.1.2/bin:/usr/local/xcov/bin:$PATH

Then switch to the Xcov "engines" example directory and exercise the
"test_engines" test there for your target, thanks to the local Makefile:

  engines $ make TARGET=powerpc-elf

Or if you want to test on a Leon board (sparc based):

  engines $ make TARGET=leon-elf

This performs a build/run/analyze sequence out of which object coverage
results rendered in sources are produced in html format, browsable from
an index page in index-test_engines.html.

Here is a brief description of what is going on:

# Step 1:  Build an executable program suitable for Qemu. This is a
# -------  regular Ada build with a couple of extra bsp components for
#          startup, io & a dedicated linker script:

powerpc-elf-gcc -c -o start.o ../support/powerpc-elf/start.s
...
powerpc-elf-gcc -c -g -O1 -fpreserve-control-flow test_engines.adb
...

# Step 2:  Run the executable program within the instrumented Qemu
# -------  to get an execution '.trace' file:

xcov run --target=powerpc-elf --level=branch test_engines

# Step 3:  Ask xcov to analyze the trace and produce an html version of
# -------  the results, with object coverage branch info rendered on source:

xcov coverage --level=branch --annotate=html+ test_engines.trace
mv index.html index-test_engines.html

The local Makefile actually just includes a generic Makefile, common to all
the examples and which you may reuse and adapt to your specific needs.

QUICK START - SOURCE COVERAGE
=============================
Source coverage analysis involves a similar process, with few differences:

* It is requested by specific values of the --level argument: stmt,
  stmt+decision or stmt+mcdc ;

* Sources should be compiled with -g -fpreserve-control-flow -gnateS,
  and currently with -O0. We don't support optimized code yet ;

* The list of units for which analysis is desired needs to be passed as
  a list of ALIs with the '--scos' option to both xcov run and xcov coverage,
  for instance via a response file (--scos=@file_with_list_of_ALIs)

This can be exercised for our examples by passing an extra XCOVLEVEL
argument to 'make' invocations, for example 'make XCOVLEVEL=stmt'.

FURTHER DOCUMENTATION
=====================
Further documentation is available from the "Xcov Fundamentals & Users Guide"
in the <unpack/installation-root>/share/doc/xcov directory of this package.
