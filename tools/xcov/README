This is the README file for the binary distribution of the Xcov coverage
analysis facility.

INSTALLING

The quick way to install is to run the script 'doinstall' contained in this
directory. This script asks a few questions about where you want the bundle to
be installed and prompts you for confirmation before proceeding with the
actual installation. At any time before this confirmation, you can interrupt
it by pressing Ctrl-C.

USE

Using Xcov is documented in the "Xcov Fundamentals & Users Guide" available in
this package, from the <installation root>/share/doc/xcov directory.

EXAMPLES

Examples are provided in the <installation root>/share/examples/xcov
directory. The "Explore" example is introduced in the user's guide and used
for illustration purposes there.
