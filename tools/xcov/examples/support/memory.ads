--  This is a simplified version of this package, for use with a configurable
--  run-time library that does not provide Ada tasking. It does not provide
--  any deallocation routine.

--  This package provides the low level memory allocation/deallocation
--  mechanisms used by GNAT.

   --  Note: the reason we redefine this here instead of using the
   --  definition in Interfaces.C is that we do not want to drag in
   --  all of Interfaces.C just because System.Memory is used.

   function Alloc (Size : size_t) return System.Address;
   --  This is the low level allocation routine. Given a size in storage
   --  units, it returns the address of a maximally aligned block of
   --  memory.
   --
   --  If size_t is set to size_t'Last on entry, then a Storage_Error
   --  exception is raised.
   --
   --  If size_t is set to zero on entry, then a minimal (but non-zero)
   --  size block is allocated.
   --
   --  Note: this is roughly equivalent to the standard C malloc call
   --  with the additional semantics as described above.
