The following is a listing of known problems in the Couverture toolset
components. Except where specifically noted, all these problems have been
corrected in the development tree, hence in wavefronts issued subsequent
to the date specified (in ISO format YYYY-MM-DD) in the status line.

L725-033 Unexpected conditional branch trace

  Problem:    Gnatcov may report unexpected conditional branch traces on sparc
              when performing decision or md/dc coverage.

  Status:     This was fixed on 2012-09-10

  Workaround: Use statement coverage level

L116-008 No coverage when executable was linked with --gc-sections

  Problem:    Xcov may report nothing if the program was linked with
              --gc-sections.

  Status:     This was fixed on 2012-01-19

  Workaround: Link without --gc-sections

K303-021 Unhandled dwarf block4 form

  Problem:    Xcov crashed if there is a block4 form in the dwarf debug
              infos.

  Status:     This was fixed on 2011-03-03

  Workaround: Remove it manually

I618-020 Unexpected file analyzed

  Problem:    A file is analyzed even if there is no routine for it in
              --routine-list file.  Xcov reports only one line with code
              for such a file.

  Status:     This was fixed on 2009-06-26

  Workaround: Ignore this additional file.

I617-022 File is anaylized twice

  Problem:    On Windows a source file is displayed twice in the html index
              with non-coherent results.

  Status:     This was fixed on 2009-06-26

  Workaround: Do not use uppercase letters in the path

I617-016 Crash while reading debug info for very high addresses

  Problem:    Xcov crashes while reading debug info for addresses near
              16#ffff_fffc# (reset entry point).

  Status:     This was fixed on 2009-06-18

  Workaround: Do not generate debug info for the reset entry point.

I527-008 Error messages printed on stderr

  Problem:    Some errors messages were not printed on stderr.

  Status:     This was fixed on 2009-05-28

  Workaround: Read messages from both stdout and stderr.

I519-015 No full coverage of conditional dynamic branches

  Problem:    It is not possible to fully cover conditional dynamic branches.

  Status:     This was fixed on 2009-05-28

  Workaround: Avoid to use powerpc bcctr/bclr instructions.

I402-007 Local object misalignment on ppc target

  Problem:    During program execution using the provided support facilities,
              objects requested to be aligned > 4 bytes boundary sometimes
              don't have their address so much aligned. This is caused by
              a misalignment of the entry stack pointer wrt the ABI mandate.

  Status:     This was fixed on 2009-04-02

  Workaround: Arrange for the entry stack pointer to be properly aligned.
