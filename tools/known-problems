The following is a listing of known problems in the Couverture toolset
components. Except where specifically noted, all these problems have been
corrected in the development tree, hence in wavefronts issued subsequent
to the date specified (in ISO format YYYY-MM-DD) in the status line.

I618-017 local object misalignment on ppc target

  Problem:    During program execution using the provided support facilities,
              objects requested to be aligned > 4 bytes boundary sometimes
              don't have their address so much aligned. This is caused by
              a misalignment of the entry stack pointer wrt the ABI mandate.

  Status:     This was fixed on 2009-04-02

  Workaround: Arrange for the entry stack pointer to be properly aligned.

I527-008 Error messages printed on stderr

  Problem:    Some errors messages were not printed on stderr.

  Status:     This was fixed on 2009-05-28

  Workaround: Read messages from both stdout and stderr.

I519-015 No full coverage of conditional dynamic branches

  Problem:    It is not possible to fully cover conditional dynamic branches.

  Status:     This was fixed on 2009-05-28

  Workaround: Avoid to use powerpc bcctr/bclr instructions.
