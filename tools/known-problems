The following is a listing of known problems in the Couverture toolset
components. Except where specifically noted, all these problems have been
corrected in the development tree, hence in wavefronts issued subsequent
to the date specified (in ISO format YYYY-MM-DD) in the status line.

I617-022 File is anaylized twice

  Problem:    On Windows a source file is displayed twice in the html index
              with non-coherent results.

  Status:     This was fixed on 2009-06-26

  Workaround: Do not use uppercase letters in the path

I617-016 Crash while reading debug info for very high addresses

  Problem:    Xcov crashes while reading debug info for addresses near
              16#ffff_fffc# (reset entry point).

  Status:     This was fixed on 2009-06-18

  Workaround: Do not generate debug info for the reset entry point.

I527-008 Error messages printed on stderr

  Problem:    Some errors messages were not printed on stderr.

  Status:     This was fixed on 2009-05-28

  Workaround: Read messages from both stdout and stderr.

I519-015 No full coverage of conditional dynamic branches

  Problem:    It is not possible to fully cover conditional dynamic branches.

  Status:     This was fixed on 2009-05-28

  Workaround: Avoid to use powerpc bcctr/bclr instructions.

I402-007 Local object misalignment on ppc target

  Problem:    During program execution using the provided support facilities,
              objects requested to be aligned > 4 bytes boundary sometimes
              don't have their address so much aligned. This is caused by
              a misalignment of the entry stack pointer wrt the ABI mandate.

  Status:     This was fixed on 2009-04-02

  Workaround: Arrange for the entry stack pointer to be properly aligned.
