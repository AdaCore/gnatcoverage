--  This program  - trace32_drv - is called by 'gnatcov run' and by
--  'gnatcov convert' when the target specified to gnatcov is one that
--  indicates that the program should be run (in the case of "'gnatcov
--  run') or was run ('gnatcov convert') through an Trace32 probe, on a
--  target board connected to that probe.
--
--  When called by 'gnatcov convert', the target executable has already
--  been executed on the processor, and generated a Branch Flow Trace
--  data file. Trace32_drv runs the program that converts the trace
--  file into the GNATCoverage format, for use by 'gnatcov coverage'.
--
--  When called by 'gnatcov run', trace32_drv controls the loading and
--  execution of the program on the target hardware to generate the
--  branch trace file, and then runs the translation step. To accomplish
--  the execution on the target, trace32_drv:
--   - Runs a python program which directs Trace32 to run the executable
--     program on the board and generate program trace data in a file.
--
--   - Runs a translation program which converts the trace from Trace32
--     into the format used by gnatcov.
--
--  When called for 'gnatcov run', 3 arguments are passed. When
--  called for 'gnatcov convert' 7 arguments are passed with the
--  first 3 being the same as for 'run'. The first 2 designate the
--  target processor and the executable run on the target. The
--  third argument is either the name of the trace file initialized by
--  gnatcov and appended to by the trace conversion program, or an argument
--  of the form 'histmap=HH,TT', where TT is the name of the trace file,
--  and HH is the name of a history file which is passed to the trace
--  conversion program to tell it to output 'history' traces and identifying
--  addresses for which history information is needed.
--
--  Their is some error checking done by this program, but
--  since it is intended to be called from gnatcov (no fat
--  fingers), many things are not checked.
--
--  This program should reside in ../libexec/gnatcoverage, relative
--  to the directory containing the gnatcov program. It expects
--  that other programs that it calls (the python program, and
--  the trace conversion program) to reside in the same directory.
--  It expcts to find the Trace32 configuration files in
--  ../../share/gnatcoverage (relative to trave32_drv itself).
