problems have been corrected in 1.2 wavefronts starting from date designated
in the "Status" indication.

KP-112-M425-007 Extreme coverage computation time with large debug info

  Problem:    gnatcov coverage appears to be running an infinite active loop
              while processing a trace associated with an executable featuring
              a very large debug info section (hundreds of megabytes). The
              process nevertheless converges after several hours.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.2 on 2013-04-26

  Workaround: Wait long enough or run gnatcov coverage on a faster machine
