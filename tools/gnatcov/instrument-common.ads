--  Common operations for source instrumentation-based coverage
--
--  Organization of instrumented projects
--  =====================================
--
--  "gnatcov instrument" generates instrumented sources in the
--  "$project_name-gnatcov-instr" subdirectory of each project's object
--  directory. The following compilation units (and source files) are
--  generated:
--
--  * "gnatcov_rts-buffers-B<SLUG>.ads" for all compilation units of interest.
--    (<SLUG> is the result of Instrumented_Unit_Slug for the compilation unit
--    to instrument). These units are preelaborated and contain definitions for
--    the coverage buffers themselves, but also for buffers "metadata".
--
--  * "gnatcov_rts-buffers-P<SLUG>.ads" for all compilation units of interest
--    (<SLUG> is the result of Instrumented_Unit_Slug for the compilation unit
--    to instrument). These units are pure and contain one System.Address
--    constant per coverage buffer for the corresponding compilation unit.
--
--  * A single "gnatcov_rts-buffers-lists-<NAME>.ads" unit (<NAME> is the name
--    of the root project). This unit contains a list of access to buffers for
--    the coverage buffers of all units of interest.
--
--  * When the buffers dump trigger is not manual (see the --dump-trigger
--    switch), "gnatcov_rts-buffers-D<SLUG>.ads" for all mains in all projects.
--    This unit contains trigger-dependent routines to implement the automatic
--    dump of coverage buffers.
--
--  * An instrumented version of all compilation units of interest. These new
--    units are replacements for the original units. They fill the coverage
--    buffers for the unit.
