Copyright (C) 2013, AdaCore

The following is a listing of known problems in release 1.1.1. All these
problems have been corrected in 1.2 wavefronts starting from date designated
in the "Status" indication.

KP-111-M105-005 Spurious gnatcov complaint on coverage -P<space><gpr>

  Problem:    gnatcov coverage -P emits a spurious complaint about a
              badly formed trace file when spaces are inserted between
              -P and the project file name on the command line.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.2 on 2013-01-05
                         and in 1.1.2 on 2013-05-28

  Workaround: Remove the spaces between -P and the project file name.

KP-111-M105-004 Gnatcov uses wrong gnatls binary to set project search path

  Problem:    gnatcov relies on calling the gnatls utility to establish
              the search path for project files. However it always called
              "gnatls" instead of the proper command for the target, which
              is "<target>-gnatls" for cross targets, and "gnatls" for native
              ones only.

  Status:     This was fixed in 1.2 on 2013-05-16
                         and in 1.1.2 on 2013-05-28

  Workaround: Add a symbolic link "gnatls" pointing to "<target>-gnatls" in
              an appropriate directory on your PATH.
