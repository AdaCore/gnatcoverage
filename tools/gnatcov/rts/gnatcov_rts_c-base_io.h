/* This header provides the smallest subset of functions needed to output
   bytes.  These functions are used in gnatcov_rts_c-traces-output-base64.c
   (and thus by the implementation of gnatcov's --dump-channel=base64-stdout
   option) to dump base64 traces to "the output": stdout when linking with a C
   runtime only, and GNAT.IO.Standard_Output when linking with an Ada runtime.

   In the former case, the gnatcov_rts_c-base_io.c module implements these
   functions, and in the latter case, itâ€™s the GNATcov_RTS.Base_IO package that
   implements them (these two units conflict with each other, so we include
   only one of them at link time).  */
