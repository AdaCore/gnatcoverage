   -- Witness subprograms --
   -------------------------

   --  The following subprograms are called by generated code to record
   --  the execution of constructs.

   --  Note that the Buffer_Address parameters below are required so that:
   --
   --  * functions don't have IN OUT formals, which are illegal before Ada
   --    2012;
   --
   --  * our hack for pure units to be able to reference coverage buffers
   --    (which are global state, i.e. unreachable from pure units) works.

   --  Statements and declarations

   --  The following Witness subprograms set the Boolean corresponding to Bit
   --  to True in Buffer in various context.

   procedure Witness (Buffer_Address : System.Address; Bit : Bit_Id);
   --  This variant is used as part of sequence of statements, to witness
   --  that we have reached a specific point in the sequence.

   type Witness_Dummy_Type is record
      Data : Boolean;
   end record;
   pragma Volatile (Witness_Dummy_Type);

   function Witness
     (Buffer_Address : System.Address; Bit : Bit_Id) return Witness_Dummy_Type;
   --  This variant is used in contexts where statements are not allowed
   --  but declarations are, for example ahead of library level declarations
   --  to witness their elaboration.

   --  Use a volatile dummy type of minimal but non-zero size to prevent the
   --  compiler from optimizing calls away, as this unit is Pure. Use a
   --  composite type to prevent ambiguities in contexts where the Boolean
   --  variant below might be used, for example in constructs like
   --
   --    case Witness (Buffer, Bit) is
   --      when others => ...
   --    end case;
   --
   --  used for some kinds of expression functions.

   type Non_Volatile_Witness_Dummy_Type is record
      Data : Boolean;
   end record;

   function Witness
     (Buffer_Address : System.Address; Bit : Bit_Id)
      return Non_Volatile_Witness_Dummy_Type;
   --  This variant uses a non-volatile return type to be compatible with ghost
   --  code.

   function Witness
     (Buffer_Address : System.Address; Bit : Bit_Id) return Boolean;
   --  This variant is used in Boolean expression contexts and always returns
   --  True.

   --  Decisions

   subtype MCDC_State_Type is Any_Bit_Id;

   --  When instrumenting expression functions, we need to conjure up storage
   --  for MC/DC state as limited aggregates. The following type provides for
   --  this use case.

   type MCDC_State_Holder is limited record
      State : aliased MCDC_State_Type;
   end record;

   function Witness
     (Buffer_Address      : System.Address;
      False_Bit, True_Bit : Bit_Id;
      Value               : Boolean) return Boolean;
   --  If Value is False, set the Boolean corresponding to False_Bit to True in
   --  Buffer. Set the one corresponding to True_Bit otherwise.

   function Witness
     (Decision_Buffer_Address : System.Address;
      False_Bit, True_Bit     : Bit_Id;
      MCDC_Buffer_Address     : System.Address;
      MCDC_Base               : Bit_Id;
      MCDC_Path_Address       : System.Address;
      Value                   : Boolean) return Boolean;
   --  Same as above, and also set the bit determined by MCDC_Base and the
   --  Bit_Id value at MCDC_Path_Address in the buffer at MCDC_Buffer_Address.
   --  Note that MCDC_Path may not be passed by value, because it is not known
   --  until the side effects of the actual for the Value formal have been
   --  evaluated.

   --  Conditions

   function Witness
     (Buffer_Address  : System.Address;
      Offset_For_True : Any_Bit_Id;
      First           : Boolean;
      Value           : Boolean) return Boolean;
   --  Buffer_Address is the address of an MCDC_State_Type local variable.
   --  If First is True, first reset it to 0.
   --  If Value is True, add Offset_For_True.
