The following is a listing of known problems in releases 1.3.1 and 1.3.2.
Each entry contains a status line stating when the problem was fixed, and on
which release(s). In addition, any wavefront issued subsequent to the date
specified (in ISO format YYYY-MM-DD) also contains the fix. This can be used
to determine if a given release or wavefront has the fix identified in the
entry.

Note that older releases might or might not be affected by the problems listed
in this document.

Known problems fixed in 1.4.1 and above
---------------------------------------

KP-13-OB26-040 Spurious coverage violations on deactivated Type_Invariant

  Problem:     GNATcoverage reports "decision never evaluated" on
               Type_Invariant expressions instructed to be ignored by
               an explicit Assertion_Policy pragma.
               
  Status:      This was fixed by a compiler adjustment in 17w on 2015-12-01
               This was fixed by a compiler adjustment in 7.4.1 on 2015-12-18

  Workaround:  Use coverage exemptions to categorize the violations as
               spurious with a justification.

KP-13-O911-032 Spurious coverage violations on types from unit in library

  Problem:     GNATcoverage reports statement coverage violations for type
               declarations provided by a unit to which a No_Elaboration_Code
               or No_Multiple_Elaboration restriction applies, when the unit
               is included by way of a library project, the static elaboration
               model is used and no variable or subprogram entity of the unit
               is referenced y the program.
               
  Status:      This was fixed by a compiler adjustment in 17w on 2015-12-01
               This was fixed by a compiler adjustment in 7.4.1 on 2015-12-18

  Workaround:  Remove the elaboration restriction on the unit, turn the
               library project into a standalone library, or arrange to
               reference some data or subprogram entity offered by the unit.

KP-13-O417-005 Possible crash when "not X" is compile time known

  Problem:     If analyzed Ada source code includes a "not X" construct that is
               not part of a decision and with "X" being a compile time known
               value, GNATcoverage may crash or provide inconsistent coverage
               reports for the corresponding unit.

  Status:      This was fixed by a compiler adjustment in 7.4 on 2015-04-28

  Workaround:  Replace such constructs with "True and then not X" so that
               "not X" is part of a decision and thus not affected by the
               issue.

KP-13-O320-024 Dead links in DHTML reports served through a Web server

  Problem:     When browsing DHTML reports that are served by a Web server on a
               non-standard port (i.e. not 80 for HTTP and not 443 for HTTPS),
               all links from the report index are invalid: they lead to a
               connection error.

  Status:      This was fixed on 2015-03-20.

  Workaround:  Download the report files and open the local files in the
               browser.

KP-13-O319-006 No report for subunits in generic units

  Problem:     GNATcoverage does not generate coverage report and thus does not
               show violations for subunits in generic units.

  Status:      This was fixed by a compiler adjustment on 2015-03-19. It is
               available from the GNAT Pro 7.4 series.

  Workaround:  Do not use subunits in generic units.
