The following is a listing of known problems in releases 1.3.1 and 1.3.2.
Each entry contains a status line stating when the problem was fixed, and on
which release(s). In addition, any wavefront issued subsequent to the date
specified (in ISO format YYYY-MM-DD) also contains the fix. This can be used
to determine if a given release or wavefront has the fix identified in the
entry.

Note that older releases might or might not be affected by the problems listed
in this document.

Known problems fixed in 1.4.1 and above
---------------------------------------

KP-13-O417-005 Possible crash when "not X" is compile time known

  Problem:     If analyzed Ada source code includes a "not X" construct that is
               not part of a decision and with "X" being a compile time known
               value, GNATcoverage may crash or provide inconsistent coverage
               reports for the corresponding unit.

  Status:      This was fixed by a compiler adjustment in 7.4 on 2015-04-28

  Workaround:  Replace such constructs with "True and then not X" so that
               "not X" is part of a decision and thus not affected by the
               issue.

KP-13-O320-024 Dead links in DHTML reports served through a Web server

  Problem:     When browsing DHTML reports that are served by a Web server on a
               non-standard port (i.e. not 80 for HTTP and not 443 for HTTPS),
               all links from the report index are invalid: they lead to a
               connection error.

  Status:      This was fixed on 2015-03-20.

  Workaround:  Download the report files and open the local files in the
               browser.

KP-13-O319-006 No report for subunits in generic units

  Problem:     GNATcoverage does not generate coverage report and thus does not
               show violations for subunits in generic units.

  Status:      This was fixed by a compiler adjustment on 2015-03-19. It is
               available from the GNAT Pro 7.4 series.

  Workaround:  Do not use subunits in generic units.
