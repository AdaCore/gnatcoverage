--  This package is used for multiple kinds of reporting, and uses a somewhat
--  generic message structure to fill that purpose. It is used to:
--
--  * Display verbose messages
--
--  * Report warnings / errors during execution
--
--  * Report coverage analysis results (e.g. coverage violation messages)
--
--  Every message emitted that is attached to a line (i.e. for which a sloc is
--  reported, most notably: coverage violation messages) is stored into gnatcov
--  internal tables, and is (in most cases) not displayed by report procedures,
--  but rather included during coverage report production.
--
--  Other messages (most warnings, errors) are simply displayed on the standard
--  output at the time the report procedure is called.
