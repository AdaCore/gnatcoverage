NF-17-P526-035 Origin_Project project file attribute handling (2016-06-13)

  Project files handling has been enhanced to account for the new
  Origin_Project project attribute. When present, it provides a default project
  of interest which overrides the project passed with the -P command line
  argument. This will help integration with other tools such as GNATtest and
  GPS.

NF-17-P107-039 Improve internal disassemblers (2016-06-06)

   GNATcoverage now leverages a subcomponent of the binutils toolsuite to
   disassemble instructions for object coverage reports. This replaces the
   so far handwritten implementation for various targets by a widely used
   and more complete component.
