NF-12-M105-006 Extended projects in --projects (2013-01-08)

  An extended project can now be named in a --projects switch, in which case
  the switch applies to the ultimate extending project. Overriding of the
  selection of units of interest from the Coverage package inproject files is
  thus properly taken into account.
