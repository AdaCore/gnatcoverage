Copyright (C) 2012-2013, AdaCore

This file contains a complete list of new features in version 1.2 of
GNATcoverage.

An ISO date (YYYY-MM-DD) appears in parentheses after the description line.
This date shows the implementation date of the feature. Any 1.2.0w wavefront
subsequent to this date will contain the indicated feature, as will any
release issued after this one.

NF-12-M405-014 Support for the dynamic html output format (2014-01-06)

  gnatcov coverage now supports --annotate=dhtml, which produces annotated
  source reports a-la html with a more modern look & feel, project file support
  (per-project indexes on the root page) and ability to sort tables of results
  by clicking on column headers.

NF-12-M105-006 Extended projects in --projects (2013-01-08)

  An extended project can now be named in a --projects switch, in which case
  the switch applies to the ultimate extending project. Overriding of the
  selection of units of interest from the Coverage package inproject files is
  thus properly taken into account.

NF-12-M726-018 Executable consistency check (2013-09-16)

  GNATcoverage now displays a warning if it notices a mismatch between analyzed
  traces and executables.
