# This directory contains a few examples illustrating possible ways to build,
# run and do coverage analysis with GNAT Pro and GNATcoverage

# Except "support", each subdirectory hosts an example and features a Makefile
# that allows launching a complete build/run/analyze sequence for a variety of
# targets, assuming you have the corresponding GNAT & GNATemulator products
# installed.

# The support subdirectory is common to all the other ones, and additional
# information about the general Makefile and project files structure is
# available in a dedicated README file there.

# Unless specified otherwise in the specific example Makefile (a couple of
# examples can only run on specific targets), you may select the following
# target to use by setting the TARGET variable explicitly:
#
# make TARGET=powerpc-elf     runs on bare PowerPC
# make TARGET=powerpc-eabispe runs on bare PowerPC/e500v2
# make TARGET=leon-elf        runs on bare LEON2
#
# as well as
#
# make TARGET=native XCOVTARGET=i686-pc-linux-gnu
#
# for native x86-linux runs relying on a specially instrumended
# version of valgrind.
