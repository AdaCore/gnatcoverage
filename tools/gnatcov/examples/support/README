This directory features a number of facilities to help automated build,
execution and cov analysis of simple examples for several possible qemu
targets. An internal "support" library is available to offer common services
to all examples, for example a custom exception last-chance handler.

The facilities in this directory include a number of GNAT project files
and Makefiles:

  * common.gpr: project file with common definitions for ...

  * libsupport.gpr: project file for both build and use of the support
                    library itself.

  and

  * base.gpr: project file to be extended by each example project file,
              to inherit a number of common attributes.

The general GPR hierarchy is as follows:

            :   common.gpr
            :      w  w
            :      |  |
  support/  :      | libsupport.gpr (With common)
            :      |  w
            :      |  |
            :    base.gpr (with common, libsupport)
                   x
                   |
 <example>/ :   example.gpr (eXtends base)

This is ~ mirrored in the Makefile organization, with 'i' to denote
inclusions:

            :    Makefile.common
            :      i         i
  support/  :      |         |
            :  .examples   .libsupport
                  i
                  |
 <example>/ :  Makefile
