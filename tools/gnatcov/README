PACKAGE CONTENTS
================

This package provides the gnatcov front-end to coverage analysis activities. 
This front-end exposes two major classes of services:

* a wrapper to an instrumented execution environment able
  to produce execution traces (gnatcov run), and 

* a trace analyzer able to render coverage results in various
  output formats (gnatcov coverage).

Instrumented execution environments are provided as part of the GNATemulator
separate product line for cross configurations. For native x86 or x86_64-linux
configurations, we rely on a Valgrind plugin to produce execution traces.

Documentation, including a getting started guide, is available from the
"GNATcoverage User's Guide" in the share/doc/gnatcoverage sub-directory of
this distribution.

This package also provides examples with Makefiles that automate the full
build/run/analyze sequence on sample programs targeted to GNATemulator.
 
The "starter" example is a very simple case meant as a quick-starter.  You can
exercise it by just switching to share/examples/gnatcoverage/starter and typing

  engines $ make [TARGET=powerpc-elf] [RTS=zfp-prep]

The local Makefile includes a generic Makefile common to all the examples, and
you may run & try the other ones similarily.

BUILD FROM SOURCES - quick example for an intel-linux host
----------------------------------------------------------

Prerequisite: GNU make, a recent Ada2012 capable GNAT compiler

1) Build & install the GNATcoll components on top of the GNAT installation,
   assumed to be in a directory designated by a "prefix" environment variable.

   gnatcov relies on the "GNAT project file" support" of GNATcoll, so
   at least this needs to be enabled:

   gnatcoll-src $ ./configure  --disable-shared --prefix=$prefix \
                    --without-python --without-iconv --enable-projects \
                    --without-sqlite --disable-syslog --without-gmp

   gnatcoll-src $ make 
   gnatcoll-src $ make install

2) Build & install a base Valgrind:

   valgrind-3.10.1 $ ./configure --prefix=$prefix
   valgrind-3.10.1 $ make install

3) Build & install the gnatcov front-end per se, plus the Valgrind trace plugin:

   couverture.git/tools/gnatcov $ make bin adapters

   couverture.git/tools/gnatcov $ make PREFIX=$prefix VALGRIND_PREFIX=$prefix \
                                       install-bin install-examples \
                                       install-adapters
