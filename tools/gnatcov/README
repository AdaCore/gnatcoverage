PACKAGE CONTENTS
================

This package provides the gnatcov front-end to coverage analysis activities, 
to be used as:

* a wrapper to an instrumented execution environment able
  to produce execution traces (gnatcov run), and 

* a trace analyzer able to render coverage results in various
  output formats (gnatcov coverage).

Instrumented execution environments are provided as part of the GNATemulator
separate product line.

Documentation, including a getting started guide, is available from the
"GNATcoverage User's Guide" in the share/doc/gnatcoverage sub-directory of
this distribution.

This package also provides examples with Makefiles that automate the full
build/run/analyze sequence on sample programs targeted to GNATemulator.
 
A quick starter is the "engines" example, very simple, which you can exercise
by just switching to share/examples/gnatcoverage/engines and typing

  engines $ make TARGET=powerpc-elf

The local Makefile (in the engines subdirectory) includes a generic Makefile
common to all the examples, and you may run & try the other ones similarily.

Specific coverage criteria can be exercised by passing an extra XCOVLEVEL
argument to 'make' invocations, for example 'make XCOVLEVEL=insn' for object
instruction coverage or 'make XCOVLEVEL=stmt' for source statement coverage.
