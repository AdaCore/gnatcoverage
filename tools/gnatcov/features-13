NF-13-NA29-019 C units-of-interest description from project files (2014-11-21)

  The project file attributes allowing the "units of interest" description
  for a project now work for C units as well.

NF-13-NA09-054 C support documentation (2014-11-21)

  The GNATcoverage capabilities regarding the C language are now
  part of the product documentation.

NF-13-NA17-035 Flag statements in non-exercised units (2014-10-20)

  When a unit of interest for source coverage is entirely missing from all
  submitted executables (i.e. has not been exercised at all), all of its
  statements are now reported as "not executed" (i.e. not covered for
  statement coverage). This ensure that a missing unit test for some
  unit in a library does not go unnoticed.

NF-13-MA15-040 ELF files memory mapping (2013-11-04)

  GNATcoverage now loads ELF files using memory mapping if available. This
  improves memory handling for loaded sections for big executables.

NF-13-N425-027 support board extensions in gnatcov run --target (2014-04-30)

  A ",<board-name>" extension to the --target argument values passed to
  gnatcov run now allows the specification of a specific board to use, of
  particular interest for GNATemulator based execution environments.

NF-13-MB05-039 gnatcov coverage --non-coverable (2013-12-12)

  gnatcov coverage now supports the --non-coverable command line option to
  expose "non-coverable" statements, that have no attached machine code and
  for which the coverage status cannot be inferred from other statements
  around.
