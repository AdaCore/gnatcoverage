   type Stat_Array is array (Any_Line_State) of Natural;
   --  Array of stats indexed by the state of a line; it records
   --  the number of occurrences of each state in a set of lines.

   function Get_Stat_String (Stats : Stat_Array) return String;
   --  Return a String image of Stats

   function Get_Total (Stats : Stat_Array) return Natural;
   --  Return total line count, excluding No_Code lines

   function Ratio (Part : Natural; Total : Natural) return Natural;
   --  Total and Part being a number of lines, compute the ratio of the two
   --  quantities (Part / Total) and return this value as a percentage.
   --
   --  This function arranges never to round towards 0 or 100 (%).
   --  This ensures that 100 or 0 are only returned for really complete
   --  coverage or absence thereof, that is, for Part == Total or Part = 0,
   --  respectively. This might incur inaccuracies when summing ratios, with
   --  sum /= 100, really minor against the representativeness of extreme
   --  values.
