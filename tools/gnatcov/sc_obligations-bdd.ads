   ------------------------------------
   -- Building the BDD of a decision --
   ------------------------------------

   --  The BDD is built while scanning the various items (conditions and
   --  operators) that make up a decision. The BDD is rooted at the first
   --  condition; each node is either the evaluation of a condition
   --  (with two outgoing arcs pointing to the continuation of the
   --  evaluation, depending on the condition's value), or a leaf indicating
   --  that the outcome of the decision has been fully determined. During
   --  BDD construction, a third type of node can appear, which is a Jump
   --  to another node (i.e. a node that has just one outgoing arc).

   --  The BDD is built by maintaining a stack of triples of BDD node ids.
   --  The node at the top of the stack designates the destinations that
   --  shall be assigned to the True and False outcomes of the subtree
   --  that is about to be scanned. The third node id, if not null, is
   --  the id of a Jump node that shall be connected to the root of the
   --  subtree about to be read.

   --  Initially, the destinations are the decision outcome leaves, and
   --  the origin is No_BDD_Node_Id.

   --  When a NOT operator is read, the True and False destinations of the
   --  top stack item are swapped.

   --  When an AND THEN operator is read, the top item is popped, and two
   --  items are pushed (corresponding to the two subtrees for the two
   --  operands). A new Jump node is allocated. The arcs for the right
   --  operand are:
   --
   --    Dest_True => Popped_Dest_True
   --      (if right op is True then overall subtree is True)
   --    Dest_False => Popped_Dest_False
   --      (if right op is True then overall subtree is False)
   --    Origin => Jump_Node
   --      (evaluation of right operand is attached as a destination
   --       of the left operand test)
   --
   --   and those for the left operand are:
   --    Dest_True => Jump_Node
   --      (if left op is True then evaluate right op)
   --    Dest_False => Popped_Dest_False
   --      (if right op is False then overall subtree is False)
   --    Origin => Popped_Origin
   --
   --  When an OR ELSE operator is read, a similar processing occurs.
   --
   --  When a condition is read, the top item is popped and a new Condition
   --  node is allocated. Its destinations are set from the popped item,
   --  and if an origin Jump node is present, then its destination is set
   --  to the id of the newly-allocated condition.
   --
   --  At the end of the processing for a decision, the stack is empty,
   --  and the BDD is simplified by replacing all references to jump nodes
   --  with direct references to their destinations.
