KP-14-P909-023 DHTML report fails on non-coverable statements

  Problem:     GNATcoverage's DHTML report fails to properly handle the
               status reported for non-coverable statements. The HTML page
               containing the annotated source doesn't load.

  Status:      This was fixed by a GNATquilt adjustment in 17w on 2016-09-29

  Workaround:  Do not use the --non-coverable switch or generate the report in
               a different format.
