   -- Witness subprograms --
   -------------------------

   --  The following subprograms are called by generated code to record
   --  the execution of constructs.

   --  Note that the Buffer_Address parameters below are required so that:
   --
   --  * functions don't have IN OUT formals, which are illegal before Ada
   --    2012;
   --
   --  * our hack for pure units to be able to reference coverage buffers
   --    (which are global state, i.e. unreachable from pure units) works.

   --  Statements and declarations

   --  The following Witness subprograms set the Boolean corresponding to Bit
   --  to True in Buffer in various context.

   procedure Witness (Buffer_Address : System.Address; Bit : Bit_Id);
   --  This variant is used as part of sequence of statements, to witness
   --  that we have reached a specific point in the sequence.

   type Witness_Dummy_Type is record
      Data : Boolean;
   end record;
   function Witness
     (Buffer_Address : System.Address; Bit : Bit_Id) return Witness_Dummy_Type;
   --  This variant is used in contexts where statements are not allowed
   --  but declarations are, for example ahead of library level declarations
   --  to witness their elaboration.

   --  Use a dummy type of minimal but non-zero size to prevent the compiler
   --  from optimizing calls away, as this unit is Pure. Use a composite type
   --  to prevent ambiguities in contexts where the Boolean variant below
   --  might be used, for example in constructs like
   --
   --    case Witness (Buffer, Bit) is
   --      when others => ...
   --    end case;
   --
   --  used for some kinds of expression functions.

   --  Buffer. Set the one corresponding to True_Bit otherwise.

   --  Same as above, and also set the bit determined by MCDC_Base and the
   --  Bit_Id value at MCDC_Path_Address in the buffer at MCDC_Buffer_Address.
   --  Note that MCDC_Path may not be passed by value, because it is not known
   --  until the side effects of the actual for the Value formal have been
   --  evaluated.

   --  Conditions
