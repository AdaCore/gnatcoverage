===================================================
== INSTALL - binary distribution                 ==
===================================================

.exe with -bin in the name, for Windows environments only
---------------------------------------------------------

The .exe version holds an installshield helper. Just double-click on the
.exe file and follow the instructions.

.zip or tar.gz archive with -bin in the name
--------------------------------------------

If you have a bash command shell or alike available, just run the "doinstall"
script and follow the instructions.

The script will ask you for the location of a place (aka prefix) where it will
transfer the contents of a "bin" and of a "shared" subdirectory.

A typical prefix is the root of your compilation toolchain install tree, where
you can copy the subdirectory contents by other means if you don't have a bash
like environment available.

If you retrieved this README from a source distribution 

  * Sources of the front-end straight at hand, together with this README
    and a Makefile;

  * Examples and the documentation in the "examples" and "doc" subdirectories
    respectively.

To build the gnatcov binary, just invoke "make". This requires an Ada 2005
capable compiler and the Makefile resorts to GNAT for this purpose.

To build pdf and other versions of the documentation, invoke "make doc".

Then, to install, make install PREFIX=<your-prefix>
