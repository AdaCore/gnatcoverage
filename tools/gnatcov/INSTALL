== INSTALL - binary distribution                 ==
===================================================

.exe with -bin in the name, for Windows environments only
---------------------------------------------------------

The .exe version holds an installshield helper. Just double-click on the
.exe file and follow the instructions.

.zip or tar.gz archive with -bin in the name
--------------------------------------------

If you have a bash command shell or alike available, just run the "doinstall"
script and follow the instructions.

The script will ask you for the location of a place (aka prefix) where it will
transfer the contents of relevant subdirectories.

A typical prefix is the root of your compilation toolchain install tree, where
you can copy the subdirectory contents by other means if you don't have a bash
like environment available.

You can also install this package in non-interactive mode by specifying
the installation directory as the parameter to doinstall:

  ./doinstall /path/to/gnatcoverage/install

=========================================================

If you retrieved this README from a source distribution 

  * Sources of the front-end straight at hand, together with this README
    and a Makefile;

  * Examples and the documentation in the "examples" and "doc" subdirectories
    respectively.

To build pdf and other versions of the documentation, invoke "make doc". This
requires a working installation of the Sphinx framework.

GNATcoverage depends on the GNATcoll components collection for project files
processing. This needs to be built and installed in your target <prefix>
first. Make sure to include --enable-projects when configuring.

To build the gnatcov binary, just invoke "make". This requires an Ada 2012
capable compiler and the Makefile resorts to GNAT for this purpose.

Then, to install, "make install PREFIX=<your-prefix>"

GNATcoverage relies on the production of execution traces by the
environment. For cross configurations (gnatcov run --target=<target>), this is
achieved by the corresponding GNATemulator companion (<target>-gnatemu) when
available on PATH or by a suitable version of Qemu.

For native configurations (typically, 32 or 64bit x86 linux, no --target
passed to gnatcov run), this is achieved by a valgrind "trace adapter". This
is built with "make adapters" and installed in an existing valgrind tree with
"make install-adapters VALGRIND_PREFIX=<root-of-your-valgrind-install-tree>".
