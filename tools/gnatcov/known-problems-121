KP-121-N102-010 Spurious incomplete decision coverage with packed array

  Problem:    When performing decision coverage analysis on code compiled
              with the GNAT Pro 7.0 series, gnatcov coverage might emit
              spurious incomplete decision coverage diagnostics for properly
              covered decisions that involve tests on packed array elements.

  Status:     This was fixed by a compiler adjustment available from the
              GNAT Pro 7.1 series.

  Workaround: Extract the tests on packed array elements out of the decision.
