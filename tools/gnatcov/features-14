NF-14-L803-037 Support for pragma Short_Circuit_And_Or (2014-11-27)

  The compiler was updated to emit proper Source Coverage Information in
  association with the code generation changes enforced to honor the
  Short_Circuit_And_Or pragma. With this pragma, non short-circuit and/or
  operators are then now considered as their short-circuit counterparts for
  source coverage analysis purposes as well.

NF-14-NC08-027 Support for Target attribute in project files (2014-12-09)

  In addition to the --target option, it is now possible to specify the target
  architecture to use in GNATcoverage thanks to the Target attribute in the
  root project file.
