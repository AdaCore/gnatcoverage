NF-14-O320-026 DHTML support ascending and descending sort order (2015-03-25)

  The DHTML output tables have been augmented to support reverse sorting on the
  second click: click once on the column header to sort the table in ascending
  order using the column as sort criteria; click a second time on the same
  column header to sort the table in descending order.

NF-14-MC05-049 Locate source files using project files (2015-03-04)

  GNATcoverage has been improved to be able to locate source files using
  information from project files. This is useful for compile units that
  generate no code.

NF-14-L803-037 Support for pragma Short_Circuit_And_Or (2014-11-27)

  The compiler was updated to emit proper Source Coverage Information in
  association with the code generation changes enforced to honor the
  Short_Circuit_And_Or pragma. With this pragma, non short-circuit and/or
  operators are then now considered as their short-circuit counterparts for
  source coverage analysis purposes as well.

NF-14-NC08-027 Support for Target attribute in project files (2014-12-09)

  In addition to the --target option, it is now possible to specify the target
  architecture to use in GNATcoverage thanks to the Target attribute in the
  root project file.
