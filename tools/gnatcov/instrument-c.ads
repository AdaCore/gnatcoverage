   --  As we want to keep some information about coverage obligations inside
   --  macro expansions (mainly to make the reporting of such coverage
   --  obligations clearer), the instrumentation of a C source file is done in
   --  2 passes:
   --
   --    * The first pass consists in recording preprocessing information. We
   --      will be able to record when a macro expansion occurs (and save the
   --      adequate information, e.g. the name of the expanded macro) and save
   --      actual source locations (we lose the column numbering when working
   --      with unpreprocessed code). Still, we are unable to instrument code
   --      in this pass (we would not be able to instrument expanded code).
   --      This leads to the second pass...
   --
   --    * The second pass consists in emitting SCOs and instrumenting the
   --      source (and works on the preprocessed source code). The SCOs
   --      designates presumed preprocessed source locations (i.e. preprocessed
   --      slocs that account for line directives). This pass also complete
   --      the preprocessing information with actual preprocessed source
   --      locations (to get an actual text of the obligation when producing a
   --      coverage report).
   --
   --  The two "passes" are intrisincally related: as we map preprocessing
   --  information over SCO ids, we need them to be consistent and identical in
   --  both passes, and thus to traverse the AST in the exact same way.
   --
   --  They thus run the same code with a few tweaks:
   --
   --     * The first pass only records preprocessing information and does not
   --       implement any of the instrumentation code.
   --
   --     * The second pass instruments the code.
   --
   --  Note that both passes fill the SCO_Table, but in the first pass, it is
   --  just done to track SCO ids. All of its content is discarded at the end
   --  of the first pass.
   --
   --  Also note that the first pass preprocesses the code internally with
   --  clang, but the second pass uses a preprocessed version of the code
   --  produced by the user's preprocessor. To have the same AST in the end, we
   --  make the assumption that we can emulate the user's preprocessor with
   --  clang (with the right set of flags, to override clang's preprocessor
   --  defaults). If this assumption does not hold, then we will probably get a
   --  different AST for both passes. For that reason, we make a consistency
   --  check after having ran both passes: if it does not hold, we will simply
   --  discard the preprocessed information recorded by the first pass, and
   --  produce a degraded report.
