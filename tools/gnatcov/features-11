NF-11-KC21-020 Project file support for SCO localization (2012-07-12)

  GNATcoverage is now able to leverage .gpr project file hierarchies to
  locate Source Coverage Obligations and help options control. This is
  available via the "-P" command line option, as for other GNAT Pro tools,
  complemented by support for a "Coverage" package in the project files.

NF-11-L725-007 Per-instance source coverage on generics (2012-12-19)

  GNATcoverage now includes support for per-instance coverage assessment of
  source level criteria on generic units, triggered by "-S instance" on the
  "gnatcov coverage" command line. This requires compiler support available
  from GNAT Pro 7.1.
