This is the root of the Couverture project source tree. This hosts
essentially two components:

     * A modified version of Qemu, instrumented to produce execution
       traces of the programs it simulates.

     * xcov, an experimental tool to produce coverage reports in various
       forms out of the execution traces.

Some documentation is available in the xcov directory: A toplevel README with
information on the binary toolset organization and a getting started guide,
and some extra documentation in the "doc" subdirectory.

-- Build components from sources --

* Qemu:

Our source base is svn revision r6588, maintained in the qemu-r6588 subdir.

First step is to "configure", with
  --target-list=ppc-softmmu \
  --disable-kqemu --disable-sdl --disable-gfx-check --disable-vnc-tls

If you are using a 32bit compiler on a 64bit linux host, prefix
your "configure" call by "linux32", like so:

  qemu/qemu-r6588 $ linux32 ./configure [...]

then, run "make" and this produces the "ppc-softmmu/qemu-system-ppc"
binary you need.

* xcov:

No need to configure, just run make.

This requires an Ada2005 capable compiler.
