======================================================================
== This is an introductory HOWTO for the current Couverture toolset == 
======================================================================

General process
---------------

The general process is as follows:

* build your executable with the powerpc-elf GNAT toolchain, with special
  glue to let the program run into qemu,

* run through our instrumented qemu to generate an execution trace,

* use our "xcov" coverage analyzer to generate user level relevant info, eg
  annotated sources, from one or more traces.

As of today, both the traces and the xcov outputs are generated in the
the current directory of the user running the command.

A simple "hello world" example is available from tests/hello in the
"couverture" repository (svn+ssh://svn.eu.adacore.com/Dev/trunk/couverture),
with a Makefile exposing the details of the different steps.

The Makefile exploits only part of the current xcov possibilities (eg defaults
to the xcov output format and is able to produce html or gcov like outputs).
"xcov -h" will list the various options with a short descriptive text.

Getting the Components
----------------------

* Compilation toolchain:

The latest powerpc-elf GNATPro release we have is 6.1.2, available for
x86-windows and sparc-solaris hosts.

For partners without access to AdaCore machines, these are available from
GNATtracker (http://www.gnattracker.com). Log in using the email address &
password which were transmitted to you by Zepur on May 5 and go to the
Download pane.

Otherwise, we also have a 20080427-41 x86-linux wavefront installed in
chinon:/usr/local, and a binary package in ~gnatmail/gcc-43/binaries:

  20081027/ppc-elf-linux/gnatpro-6.2.0w-20081027-43-powerpc-elf-chinon.tar.gz

* Qemu:

A binary version is built nightly on two AdaCore machines: chinon (x86-linux)
and tallinn (x86-windows), avail in ~gnatmail/gcc-41/install-<machine>/bin/.

Sources to build elsewhere if need be are available from
svn+ssh://svn.eu.adacore.com/Dev/trunk/qemu.

The base "configure" options to use are:
  --target-list=ppc-softmmu
  --disable-kqemu --disable-sdl --disable-gfx-check --disable-vnc-tls

Be sure to use a 3.x GCC to build from sources. There are known problems
with the 4.x series.

And if you are using a 32bit compiler on a 64bit host on linux, prefix
your "configure" call by "linux32", like so:

  qemu/qemu-0.9.1 $ linux32 ./configure [...]

then, run "make" and this produces the "ppc-softmmu/qemu-system-ppc"
binary you need.

* xcov

A binary version is built on AdaCore machines together with Qemu.

Sources to build elsewhere if need be are available from
svn+ssh://svn.eu.adacore.com/Dev/trunk/couverture/tools/xcov (make).
