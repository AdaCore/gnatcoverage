======================================================================
== This is an introductory HOWTO for the current Couverture toolset == 
======================================================================

We now have binary packages built nightly for x86-linux and windows hosts,
available from EU AdaCore machines as 

  ~gnatmail/gcc-43/binaries/<date>/x86-windows|linux/couverture-...

each package contains a toplevel README with everything needed to proceed
further.

The source repo URL is svn+ssh://svn.eu.adacore.com/Dev/trunk/couverture

To run examples, the latest powerpc-elf GNATPro release we have is 6.2.1,
available for x86-windows and sparc-solaris hosts.

For partners without access to AdaCore machines, these are available from
GNATtracker (http://www.gnattracker.com). Log in using the email address &
password which were transmitted to you by Zepur on May 5 and go to the
Download pane.

Otherwise, we have a nightly 20080427-41 x86-linux wavefront installed in
chinon:/usr/local, and binary packages in ~gnatmail/gcc-43/binaries, for
instance

  20081027/ppc-elf-linux/gnatpro-6.2.0w-20081027-43-powerpc-elf-chinon.tar.gz

* Qemu:

For sparc support and ability to compile with gcc 4, we switched to a
development version. Our source base is maintained in the qemu-r6588
subdir of the couverture repository.

First step is to "configure", with
  --target-list=ppc-softmmu
  --disable-kqemu --disable-sdl --disable-gfx-check --disable-vnc-tls

If you are using a 32bit compiler on a 64bit host on linux, prefix
your "configure" call by "linux32", like so:

  qemu/qemu-0.9.1 $ linux32 ./configure [...]

then, run "make" and this produces the "ppc-softmmu/qemu-system-ppc"
binary you need.

* xcov

Sources are available from
svn+ssh://svn.eu.adacore.com/Dev/trunk/couverture/tools/xcov.

No need to configure, just run make.

This requires an Ada2005 capable compiler.
